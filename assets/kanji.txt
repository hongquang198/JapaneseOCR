1	one	Nhất	一	One	1	1	In Chinese characters, the number one is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right.	* As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of floor or ceiling, depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means ceiling; if below, floor.	One down, 2041 to go. ;).	"To learn this one kanji, I recommend (#2000) this story : Bambi is in a cave, eating a side-dish of salad when trying to learn the kanjis. As he succeed to learn the kanji for ""one"", you get jealous and decide to shoot him with a slingshot. At this moment you hear the police coming, so you hurriedly burn all the proofs into a fire (so you remove the key-words Bambi, slingshot and fire from recommend). So that when the police arrives, the only remaining clue is a single horizontal bar."	1	5	イチ、イツ	ひと-、ひと.つ	一度 (いちど), 一座 (いちざ), 第一 (だいいち), 一 (ひと), 一つ (ひと.つ)
2	two	Nhị	二	two	2	1	Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for two is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter.		Two lines.	Roman numeral II, written on its side.	1	5	ニ、ジ	ふた、ふた.つ、ふたた.び	二 (ふた), 二つ (ふた.つ)
3	three	Tam	三	three	3	1	"And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for three simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of ""1 + 2 = 3"" (一 + 二 = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter."		One + two = three.	THREE measurements define the female shape: BUST, WAIST, and HIPS. Waist is the smallest, and for most women the HIPS are wider than the chest.	1	5	サン、ゾウ	み、み.つ、みっ.つ	三 (み), 三つ (み.つ), 三つ (みっ.つ)
4	four	Tứ	四	four, pent in, human legs	5	1	"This character is composed of two primitive elements, mouth and human legs, both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the ""story"" connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast."		FOUR year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize.	I imagine a giant devouring a human in four bites. First the giant bites off the person´s head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the fourth bite falling in there?	1	5	シ	よ、よ.つ、よっ.つ、よん	四 (よ), 四つ (よ.つ), 四つ (よっ.つ), 四 (よん)
5	five	Ngũ	五	five	4	1	As with four, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for five.		三 + two vertical lines = 5.	"This Kanji looks like a ""3"" Kanji with two added vertical lines. 3+2= 5."	1	5	ゴ	いつ、いつ.つ	五 (いつ), 五つ (いつ.つ)
6	six	Lục	六	six, top hat, animal legs	4	1	The primitives here are top hat and animal legs. Once again, we glide over them until later.		Indicating 6 parts of the human body: head, body, 2 arms, 2 legs.	Six-Six-SIX ((666)) Mark of the Beast!! Imagine that dapper old beastly fellow summoning his top hat to himself. See it scamper over to him on a little pair of beastly legs.	1	5	ロク、リク	む、む.つ、むっ.つ、むい	六 (む), 六つ (む.つ), 六つ (むっ.つ)
7	seven	Thất	七	seven, diced	2	1	"Note that the first stroke ""cuts"" through the second. This distinguishes seven from the character for spoon (Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short."	"* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of diced, i.e., ""cut"" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for cut to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89)."	This kanji is our good old seven, turned upside down.	I wrote it upside down so I crossed it out.	1	5	シチ	なな、なな.つ、なの	七 (なな), 七つ (なな.つ)
8	eight	Bát	八	eight	2	1	"Just as the Arabic numeral ""8"" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for eight is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the ""lazy 8"" is the mathematical symbol for ""infinity,"" so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something ""all-encompassing."""		"Hachi (eight) begins with the sound of the katakana ""ha"", and it´s approximately the same character."	The valcano hasn´t erupted for 8 years.	1	5	ハチ	や、や.つ、やっ.つ、よう	八 (や), 八つ (や.つ), 八つ (やっ.つ)
9	nine	Cửu	九	nine, baseball	2	1	If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for power (Frame 922).	* As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean baseball team or simply baseball. The meaning, of course, is derived from the nine players who make up a team.	Kinda of looks like the kanji of 1　一 with the kanji of 8 八added. So think of it as 　一＋八＝九.	Warning - naughty reminder A woman in the doggie style position, waiting for my NINE inches.	1	5	キュウ、ク	ここの、ここの.つ	九百 (きゅうひゃく), 三拝九拝 (さんはいきゅうはい), 九 (ここの), 九つ (ここの.つ)
10	ten	Thập	十	ten, needle	2	1	Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral ten.	* As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of ten and sometimes signifies needle, this latter derived from the kanji for needle (Frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.	Two needles crossing marks the spot, or you can use the Roman character for ten (rotated 45 degrees).	I scared away ten vampires with a single cross!	1	5	ジュウ、ジッ、ジュッ	とお、と	十字架 (じゅうじか), 十文字 (じゅうもんじ), 十 (と), 十 (とお)
11	mouth	Khẩu	口	mouth	3	1	Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for mouth is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.	* As a primitive, this form also means mouth. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning.	Looks like a huge open mouth.	"Momma used to say: ""Keep your trap shut!"" This thing is shaped like a trap door."	1	4	コウ、ク	くち	口述 (こうじゅつ), 人口 (じんこう), 開口 (かいこう), 口 (くち)
12	day	Nhật	日	day, sun	4	1	"This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, ""Have a nice day!"""	"* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean sun or day or a tongue wagging in the mouth. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like ""sayeth"" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620)."	Open the window, new day.	Picture two halves of a 24-hr period: Day & Night.	1	5	ニチ、ジツ	ひ、-び、-か	日時 (にちじ), 日光 (にっこう), 毎日 (まいにち), 日 (か), 日 (ひ)
13	month	Nguyệt	月	month, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	4	1	"This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical ""man in the moon."" (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one month, of course, is one cycle of the moon."	* As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of moon, flesh, or part of the body. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.	A month is longer than a day.	"Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air ""mooning"" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of month, considering that months were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning ""ass"" part of it connects well to Hesig´s seemingly unconnected ""flesh"" or ""part of the body"" meaning (when used in primitive form)."	1	5	ゲツ、ガツ	つき	月曜 (げつよう), 明月 (めいげつ), 歳月 (さいげつ), 月 (つき)
14	rice field	Điền	田	rice field, brains	5	1	Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a rice field divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4.	* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of rice field is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of brains from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.	A rice field divided into four parts.	Ten people use their mouths to eat the yield of the rice fields.	1	4	デン	た	田 (た)
15	eye	Mục (Mục tiêu, mục đích)	目	eye	5	1	Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an eye.	* As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of eye, or more specifically, an eyeball. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side.	There are 3 sections. Imagine the outer two being the whites of your eye. The middle is the pupil. Fill it in with imaginary color.	目_目.	1	4	モク、ボク	め、-め、ま-	目的 (もくてき), 目前 (もくぜん), 項目 (こうもく), 目 (め)
16	old	Cổ	古	old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	5	2	"The primitive elements that compose this character are ten and mouth, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with old inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character ""drawings."""	* Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of old, but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.	Tombstone and cross on an old man´s grave.	You get OLD fast if you have ten open mouths to feed.	2	4	コ	ふる.い、ふる-、-ふる.す	古い (ふる.い), 古す (ふる.す)
17	I	Ngô	吾	I, five, mouth	7	2	"There are actually a number of kanji for the word I, but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the ""perceiving subject."" Now the one place in our bodies that all five senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than five mouths: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, five mouths = I."		I eat five times at day.	I have 5 senses.	Names		ゴ	われ、わが-、あ-	
18	risk	Mao (Mao hiểm (mạo hiểm))	冒	risk, sun, day, eye	9	2	Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the sun for fear you might burn out your eyes? Probably you were foolish enough to risk a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a sun above and an eye right below looking up at it has the meaning of risk (see frame 12).		Don´t look at the sun directly with your eyes, it´s risky!	You´ll risk your eyesight if you look up at the sun.	JH	1	ボウ	おか.す	冒す (おか.す)
19	companion	Bằng (Bằng hữu)	朋	companion, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, moon2, month2, flesh2, part of the body2	8	2	"The first companion that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam exclaimed, ""Flesh of my flesh!"" And that is precisely what this character says in so many strokes."		My companion and I are like two moons side by side.	Under the twin moons of Tatooine, Luke had no COMPANION.	Names	1	ホウ	とも	
20	bright	Minh	明	bright, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	8	2	Among nature's bright lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the sun, the bright insight of the clear thinker, and the moon, the bright intuition of the poet and the seer (see frame 13).		The sun makes the moon bright.	The sun and the moon are brightest objects in the day and night, respectively.	2	4	メイ、ミョウ、ミン	あ.かり、あか.るい、あか.るむ、あか.らむ、あき.らか、あ.ける、-あ.け、あ.く、あ.くる、あ.かす	明暗 (めいあん), 説明 (せつめい), 鮮明 (せんめい), 明かす (あ.かす), 明かり (あ.かり), 明く (あ.く), 明くる (あ.くる), 明ける (あ.ける), 明らむ (あか.らむ), 明るい (あか.るい), 明るむ (あか.るむ), 明らか (あき.らか)
21	chant	XƯỚNG (hát trước để cho người ta họa)	唱	chant, mouth, prosperous, sun, day, tongue wagging, sun2, day2, tongue wagging2		2	This one is easy! You have one mouth making no noise (the choirmaster) and two mouths with wagging tongues (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, chant, as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11).		Someone chanting with their mouth open for two consecutive days.	Chants from our mouths are meant to reach the sun and the stars. Stars are just suns just further away so they seem smaller.	4	1	ショウ	とな.える	唱える (とな.える)
22	sparkle	Tinh (Kết tinh..)	晶	sparkle, day, sun, day3, sun3	12	2	"What else can the word sparkle suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature sun. This kanji is a picture of a tiny sun in three places (that is, ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something that sparkles on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole."		A diamond sparkles as brightly as three suns.	Sparkle is a forest (#197) of suns!	JH	1	ショウ		
23	goods	Phẩm (Phẩm vật, phế phẩm)	品	goods, mouth, mouth3	9	2	"As in the character for sparkle, the triplication of a single element in this character indicates ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of."" When we think of goods in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass-produced - that is to say, produced for the ""masses"" of open mouths waiting like fledglings in a nest to ""consume"" whatever comes their way."		Three boxes of goods are devoured by the hungry mouths of waiting consumers.	Three hungry mouths waiting for the goods to come.	3	4	ヒン、ホン	しな	品 (しな)
24	spine	Lữ, lã	呂	spine, mouth, drop, mouth2	7	2	This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the spine linked by a single stroke.		Spine connects head and body.	The spine goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals). Just think of these openings being enlarged to represent the head and the body. The bottom is bigger because the body is bigger than the face.	JH	1	ロ、リョ	せぼね	
25	prosperous	Xương (phồn xương (thịnh vượng))	昌	prosperous, sun, day, sun2, day2	8	2	"What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of"" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see two suns, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the three suns of sparkle. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of prosperous times as sunny, what could be more prosperous than a sky with two suns in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there."		If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be prosperous.	I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like ´fortune´, so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from ´Star Trek´ (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase ´live long and PROSPER´? If that´s not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.	Names	1	ショウ	さかん	
26	early	Tảo (tảo hôn)	早	early, sunflower, sun, day, ten, needle	6	2	This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the sunflower, since it begins with the element for sun and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine sunflowers with needles for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of early is easily remembered if one thinks of the sunflower as the early riser in the garden, because the sun, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10).	* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of sunflower, which was used to make the abstract key word early more graphic.	The sun up is early, well before ten.	An early sun-flower looks like a miniature sun perched on a needlelike stems.	1	4	ソウ、サッ	はや.い、はや、はや-、はや.まる、はや.める、さ-	早期 (そうき), 早晩 (そうばん), 早々に (そうそうに), 早い (はや.い), 早まる (はや.まる), 早める (はや.める)
27	rising sun	Húc (bóng sáng như mặt trời mọc)	旭	rising sun, nine, baseball, sun, day	6	2	This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the rising sun. If you can picture two seams running down that great red sun, and then imagine it sitting on a baseball bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the Rising Sun.		Nine planets revolve around our rising sun.	9am carries with it the rising sun.	Names	1	キョク	あさひ	
28	generation	Thế (Thế đại, thế kỉ, hậu thế)	世	generation, ten, twenty	5	2	"We generally consider one generation as a period of thirty (or ten plus ten plus ten) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three tens. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as ""addition"" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: ten ""plus"" ten ""plus"" ten = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book."		3 tens = generation.	"They SAY a generation is ten+ten+ten years, with the big first ten providing a grounding, and the next ten providing a little more grounding for the final ten. But I wish the next generation didn´t always SAY ""yo!"". (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo)."	3	4	セイ、セ、ソウ	よ、さんじゅう	世紀 (せいき), 時世 (じせい), 処世 (しょせい), 世 (よ)
29	stomach	Vị (khẩu vị, thượng vị)	胃	stomach, rice field, brains, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	9	2	"You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: flesh (part of the body) and brain. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the part of the body that keeps the brain in working order is the stomach. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the brain as being ""held up"" by the flesh."		The rice field is harvested once a month to get food for our stomach.	The stomach is the part of the body that digests food (which, in Japan, is mainly rice).	4	2	イ		
30	daybreak	Đán (Nguyên đán)	旦	nightbreak, sun, one, floor	5	2	"While we normally refer to the start of the day as ""daybreak,"" Japanese commonly refers to it as the ""opening up of night"" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, nightbreak. The single stroke at the bottom represents the floor (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the sun is poking its head"		A nightbreak happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).	"It may be easier to think of the keyword ""DAYBREAK"" or ""MORNING"" for this kanji (other kanji dictionaries do). Then the mnemonic phrase ""SUN rising over the HORIZON"" works better. It is an infrequent kanji, but can be found in: 旦夕　（たんせき） morning and evening, or 元旦　（がんたん） New Year´s Day."	JH	1	タン、ダン	あき.らか、あきら、ただし、あさ、あした	
31	gall bladder	Đảm (đảm thạch chứng (bệnh sỏi mật))	胆	gallbladder, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, nightbreak, sun, day, one, floor	9	2	"The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for part of the body, and on the right, the character for nightbreak, which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the gall bladder is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the gall bladder is supposed to filter out), and change it to ""not letting the night break on your anger"" (or your gall) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then ""sleeping it off."""		All the month long I have to start working at nightbreak. This really activates my gall bladder (=I get angry).	The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.	JH	1	タン	きも	
32	span	Tuyên (ngang qua)	亘	span, one, ceiling, sun, day, one, floor	6	2	"""Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset..."" goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the floor) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead (ceiling) and then disappears over the other horizon - day after day, marking the span of our lives."		The sun spans from horizon to horizon in a day.	The span of the day is the time between the sun goes up and comes down.	Names	1	コウ、カン	わた.る、もと.める	
33	concave	Ao (ao diện kính (thấu kính lõm))	凹	concave	5	2	"You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a concave lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little ""cave."" Now all you have to do is learn how to write it."		"The letter ""U"" is concavely written."	Concave has a concave shape.	JH	1	オウ	くぼ.む、へこ.む、ぼこ	
34	convex	Đột (đột ao, đột kính)	凸	convex	5	2	Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping convex distinct from concave. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it.		When I get vexed, I give people the middle finger.	Convex has a convex shape.	JH	1	トツ	でこ	
35	olden times	Cựu	旧	olden times, stick, sun, day	5	3	"A walking stick is needed for days of olden times, since days, too, get old - at least insofar as we refer to them as the ""good old days."" The main thing here is to think of ""good old days"" when you hear the key word olden times. The rest will take care of itself."		Age 18 = olden times.	The old man with a walking stick kept talking of olden times all day long.	5	2	キュウ	ふる.い、もと	
36	oneself	Tự (tự thú, tự lập, tự vệ)	自	oneself, drop, eye	6	3	You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little drop that Mother Nature set between your eyes. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for oneself.	* The same meaning of oneself can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of nose or nostrils, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for nose (Frame 733).	Faced with his clone, our hero valiantly cut a mark on his forehead right above his eye so that his comrades could tell his true oneself from the enemy.	To use an eyedropper by oneself, aim from above to put a drop into the eye.	2	4	ジ、シ	みずか.ら、おの.ずから、おの.ずと	自分 (じぶん), 自由 (じゆう), 各自 (かくじ), 自ら (みずか.ら)
37	white	Bạch (minh bạch)	白	white, drop, sun, day	5	3	The color white is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single drop of sun spells white.	* As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of white or take the more graphic meaning of a white bird or dove. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for bird, which we shall get to later (Frame 2091).	A white ray is a drop of sun.	Even a small drop (´) of the sun (日) would make you see nothing but white.	1	5	ハク、ビャク	しろ、しら-、しろ.い	白髪 (しらが), 紅白 (こうはく), 明白 (めいはく), 白 (しろ), 白い (しろ.い)
38	hundred	Bách (bách khoa, bách chiến bách thắng)	百	hundred, one, ceiling, white, dove	6	3	"The Japanese refer to a person's 99th birthday as a ""white year"" because white is the kanji you are left with if you subtract one from a hundred."		100 turned sideways. {sort of the same as what ashoksaraf said}.	That dirty ceiling was painted WHITE a hundred times!	1	5	ヒャク、ビャク	もも	
39	in	Trung (Trong. Như đối với các tỉnh ngoài thì gọi chỗ kinh đô là trung ương, v.v.)	中	in, stick, mouth	4	3	The elements here are a walking stick and a mouth. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine in your mouth? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather's walking stick, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something in from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil into a baby's mouth.		Pocky goes in the mouth. Or My GF lets me come in her mouth (pictogram).	My GF lets me come in her mouth (pictogram).	1	5	チュウ	なか、うち、あた.る	中 (なか)
40	thousand	Thiên (Thiên niên)	千	thousand, drop, ten, needle	3	3	This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the drop above and the ten below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number ten to make it a thousand.		It takes many drops of ten to get to a thousand.	One T = one thousand.	1	5	セン	ち	千 (ち)
41	tongue	Thiệt (ác thiệt (kẻ xấu miệng, ngồi lê mách lẻo))	舌	tongue, thousand, drop, ten, needle, mouth	6	3	"The primitive for mouth and the character for thousand naturally form the idea of tongue if one thinks of a thousand mouths able to speak the same language, or as we say, ""sharing a common tongue."" It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single tongue being passed around from mouth to mouth."		Kissing a thousand mouths eventually gets you some tongue.	What is in a mouth that permits it to speak a thousand things? Yes, a tongue.	5	1	ゼツ	した	舌 (した)
42	measuring box	Thăng (đơn vị đo đạc)	升	measuring box, thousand, drop, ten, needle	4	3	This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a thousand sharp needles, and the quaint little measuring box becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of thousand. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last.		It is a thousand or ten? I need my measuring box.	I can fit a thousand needles into my measuring box, but only if I bend the thousand.	JH	1	ショウ	ます	升 (ます)
43	rise up	Thăng (thăng tiến, thăng cấp)	昇	rise up, sun, day, measuring box, thousand, drop, ten, needle	8	3	"Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a sun and a measuring box. Just as the sun can be seen rising up in the morning from - where else - the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the sun rising up out of a Japanese measuring box - the ""measuring box of the rising-up sun."""		"This kanji does not mean ""get up"" or ""awake."" It means rising, like the rising of a salary, or a promotion. STORY: You know that your salary has RISEN UP when your MEASURING BOX has enough dollar bills in it to reach the SUN."	We Measure the Sun to decide when we should Rise Up out of bed.	JH	2	ショウ	のぼ.る	昇る (のぼ.る)
44	round	Hoàn (viên tròn)	丸	round, drop, nine, baseball	3	3	"We speak of ""round numbers,"" or ""rounding a number off,"" meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest drop, to nine, you end up with a round number."	* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a fat man. Think of a grotesquely fat man whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a round baseball player becomes a fat man.	Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten!	"Watch out for plump (#120). Here Heisig could have added a ""t"" and we would have had a much better keyword : rotund. Rotund is more specific than ""round"" which begs for confusion with circle (#1811). A dictionary search on ""fat"" or ""round"" doesn´t yield this kanji, but ""rotund"" does! Primitive suggestion: the Laughing Buddha is often depicted as a rotund, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude)."	2	2	ガン	まる、まる.める、まる.い	丸 (まる), 丸い (まる.い), 丸める (まる.める)
45	measurement	Thốn (tấc, mười phân là một tấc)	寸	measurement, glue, drop, ten with a hook	3	3	This kanji actually stood for a small measurement used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of measurement. In the old system, it was one-tenth of a shaku (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one drop of a ten (with a hook!).	* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean glue or glued to. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it.	The decimal system uses drops of ten as a measurement.	Glue two sticks together to make the best measurement. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.).	6	1	スン		
47	specialty	Chuyên (chuyên môn, chuyên nghiệp, chuyên dụng)	専	specialty, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue	9	3	"Ten . . . rice fields . . . glue. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get: ""Ten rice fields glued together."" A specialty, of course, refers to one's special ""field"" of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single specialty and usually extend themselves in other fields as well. This is how we come to get the picture of ten fields glued together to represent a specialty."		After you have chosen your 10 fields of study, measure how good you are at each to find out your specialty.	10 brains glued together allows you to specialize in any specialty that you want. Imagine each brain having its own specialty.	6	2	セン	もっぱ.ら	専ら (もっぱ.ら)
48	Dr.	Bác (bác học, bác sĩ)	博	Dr., ten, needle, acupuncturist, specialty, drop, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue	12	3	At the left we have the needle; at the right, the kanji for specialty, plus an extra drop at the top. Think of a Dr. who is a specialist with a needle (an acupuncturist) and let the drop at the top represent the period at the end of Dr. In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.	* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the needle on the left and gets the meaning of an acupuncturist.	Ten specialties grants you the title of Dr. with a dot.	"Watch for doctor (#1694), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well ""learned"", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 (""doctor"") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as ""Dr. Who"", ""Dr. Jekyll"", even ""Dr. Dobb´s"" if you´re into programming."	4	1	ハク、バク		博識 (はくしき), 博覧 (はくらん), 博士号 (はくしごう)
49	fortune-telling	Chiếm, chiêm (chiêm tinh)	占	fortune-telling, magic wand, augury, divining rod, mouth	5	3	This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a divining rod with a mouth - which translate directly into fortune-telling. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first divining rod, then mouth. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.		Fortune-telling: using a mouth as a divining rod.	"A great number of people who do fortune-telling are ""almost old""."	JH	2	セン	し.める、うらな.う	占う (うらな.う), 占める (し.める)
50	above	Thượng (thượng vị, thượng lưu)	上	above, magic wand, augury, divining rod, one, floor	3	3	"The two directions, above and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a magic wand standing above a floor - ""magically,"" you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words above and below suggest each other."		A magic wand standing on above the floor.	Above all else, be grounded if you are going to practice augury (#2103)卜. You could turn yourself into a トoad...　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ジョウ　以上　いじょう(above)　　　　ショウ　上人　しょうにん(saint).	1	5	ジョウ、ショウ、シャン	うえ、-うえ、うわ-、かみ、あ.げる、-あ.げる、あ.がる、-あ.がる、あ.がり、-あ.がり、のぼ.る、のぼ.り、のぼ.せる、のぼ.す、よ.す	上旬 (じょうじゅん), 上昇 (じょうしょう), 地上 (ちじょう), 上がる (あ.がる), 上げる (あ.げる), 上 (うえ), 上 (かみ), 上す (のぼ.す), 上せる (のぼ.せる), 上る (のぼ.る)
51	below	Hạ	下	below, one, ceiling, magic wand, augury, divining rod	3	3	Here we see our famous miraculous magic wand hanging, all on its own, below the ceiling, as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for ceiling and floor, by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and below the primitive element to which it is related.		Roots are below the ground.	A magic wand hanging below the ceiling.	1	5	カ、ゲ	した、しも、もと、さ.げる、さ.がる、くだ.る、くだ.り、くだ.す、-くだ.す、くだ.さる、お.ろす、お.りる	下流 (かりゅう), 下降 (かこう), 落下 (らっか), 下りる (お.りる), 下ろす (お.ろす), 下さる (くだ.さる), 下す (くだ.す), 下る (くだ.る), 下がる (さ.がる), 下げる (さ.げる), 下 (した), 下 (しも), 下 (もと)
52	eminent	Trác (trác tuyệt (tài trí tuyệt trần))	卓	eminent, magic wand, augury, divinging rod, sunflower, sun, day, ten, needle	8	3	The word eminent suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a magic wand and a sunflower - is to think of the world's most eminent magician as one who uses a sunflower for a magic wand (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love).		The most eminent magician is he who learned to use his magic wand early in life.	The eminent sunflower is the one that stands above the others.	JH	1	タク		
53	morning	Triều (mỗi triều (hàng sáng))	朝	morning, mist, ten, needle, early, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, ten2, needle2	12	3	On the right we see the moon fading off into the first light of morning, and to the left, the mist that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the moon tilting over to spill mist on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character.		"Morning has come ""ten"" hours ""early""!!! The ""moon"" is still in the sky!"	There is mist as the moon fades away in the morning.	2	4	チョウ	あさ	朝 (あさ)
55	only	Chỉ	只	only, mouth, animal legs, eight	5	4	"When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression ""it's the only one of its kind."" Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic mouth and two wee animal legs."		My girlfriend insists that the only thing I want from her is what´s between her legs and her mouth.. She´s drawn me this pictograph to demonstrate. It´s a mouth and two legs spread apart.. I explain that I also love her breasts, and then she smacks me in the face. I´ll never understand women.. (I keep failing this kanji, hopefully this silly story will help me!).	Imagine an animal with CHỈ a mouth and legs.	Names	1	シ	ただ	
56	shellfish	BỐI (Con sò, ngày xưa dùng vỏ sò làm tiền tiêu, cho nên những chữ nói về của cải phần nhiều có chữ bối ở bên. Những đồ quý báu gọi là bảo bối)	貝	shellfish, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	7	4	To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an eye and animal legs, you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a shellfish with its ridged shell at the top and two little legs sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish shellfish with a single, gigantic eye roaming the beaches on its slender little legs, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers.	* When used as a primitive, in addition to shells, the meanings oyster and clam will often come in handy.	Eye thought I saw a shellfish legging it down the beach!	Stare at the shellfish, it looks like an eye with legs.	1	2	バイ	かい	貝 (かい)
58	upright	TRINH (Trinh, chính đính, giữ được tấm lòng chính đính thủy chung không ai làm lay động được gọi là trinh. Như trung trinh, kiên trinh, v.v... Đàn bà không thất tiết (không yêu ai, chỉ yêu một chồng) gọi là trinh phụ. Con gái chính đính (không theo trai) gọi là trinh nữ.)	貞	upright, magic wand, augury, divining rod, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	9	4	Now take the last primitive, the shellfish, and set a magic wand over it, and you have the kanji for upright. After all, the clam and the oyster are incapable of walking upright. It would take a magician with his wand to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji.		A magic wand is needed to make a clam stand upright.	Just the thought of my magic wand on her clam makes my magic wand stand upright.	JH	1	テイ	さだ	
59	employee	VIÊN (Nhân viên, thành viên, người.)	員	employee, mouth, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	10	4	How do we get a mouth over a shellfish to mean an employee? Simple. Just remember the advice new employees get about keeping their mouths shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with clams pinched to their mouths.		An employee (member of the company) has to clam up his mouth if he wants keep the job!	An employee is basically a shellfish with a mouth.	3	4	イン		
61	see	KIẾN (Thấy, mắt trông thấy.)	見	see, eye, human legs	7	4	The elements that compose the character for see are the eye firmly fixed to a pair of human legs. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character....		Eyes and legs are all you need to see the world.	As a primitive, this is Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc. (the giant eyeball with legs...) Makes for easy stories later on.	1	5	ケン	み.る、み.える、み.せる	見える (み.える), 見せる (み.せる), 見る (み.る)
62	newborn babe	NHI (Nhi đồng, hài nhi)	児	newborn babe, olden times, stick, sun, day, human legs	7	4	"The top part of the kanji in this frame, you will remember, is the character for olden times, those days so old they needed a walking stick to get around. Western mythical imagination has old ""Father Time"" leaning on his sickle with a newborn babe crawling around his legs, the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for olden times will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it."		Only 18 and already got a newborn babe. Young girls are so quick to spread their legs these days...　　　RTK2:　ジ　児童　じどう　(child)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　ニ　小児　しょうに(infant).	In the olden times, a new-born baby came out legs first.	4	2	ジ、ニ、ゲイ	こ、-こ、-っこ	児童 (じどう), 幼児 (ようじ), 優良児 (ゆうりょうじ)
63	beginning	NGUYÊN (Nguyên đán, kỷ nguyên (Lịch tây, lấy năm chúa Gia-tô giáng sinh, để ghi số năm, nên gọi năm ấy là kỷ NGUYÊN, nghĩa là số một bắt đầu từ đấy))	元	beginning, two, human legs	4	4	"""In the beginning..."" starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made two of them, man and woman. While we presume she made two of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only two and a pair of human legs come to the kanji that means beginning."		In the BEGINNING were just two who walked on human legs.	"In the beginning God created woman, and God asked her how she liked his work. Woman replied, ""Well, you know how I have two eyes, two arms, two legs... it seems redundant to have three breasts. It would look more symmetrical with two."" God nodded, and the middle breast fell off... and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, ""Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?"" And God created man. That´s why the women today only have two boobs to match their two human legs."	2	4	ゲン、ガン	もと	元素 (げんそ), 元気 (げんき), 多元 (たげん), 元 (もと)
64	page	HIỆT (Đầu) Một tờ giấy gọi là nhất hiệt.	頁	page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	9	4	"What we have to do here is turn a shellfish into a page of a book. The one at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only one page. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an oyster, let us say ""Pearl of Wisdom,"" and then open the quaint book to its one and only page, on which you find a single, radiant drop of wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature."	* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a head (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for head (Frame 1549).	A shellfish carrying a page balanced on its head.	One drop of ink from a shellfish can fill a whole page.	Names		ケツ	ぺえじ、おおがい、かしら	
65	stubborn	NGOAN (Ngu, ương, không biết gì mà lại làm càn gọi là ngoan.) (Ngoan cường, ngoan cố)	頑	stubborn, beginning, two, human legs, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	13	4	"This character refers to the blockheaded, persistent stubbornness of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the beginning, without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes ""sense,"" but is hard to remember because the word ""beginning ""is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all stubbornness goes back to the beginning, with two brothers each stubbornly defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled heads, each vying for the favors of heaven, a stubborn grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened!"		Picture a stubborn schoolboy, with his arms crossed and his book still open to the BEGINNING PAGE. Despite the teacher telling him to turn the page, he refuses and keeps his book on the BEGINNING PAGE.	A STUBBORN person in the beginning gets something into their head and can´t change their mind.	JH	1	ガン	かたく	
66	mediocre	PHÀM (Phàm nhân, siêu phàm)	凡	mediocre, drop, wind	3	4	"While we refer to something insignificant as a ""drop in the bucket,"" the kanji for mediocre suggests the image of a ""drop in the wind."""		A drop of breeze is naught but a mediocre wind.	Is there anything as mediocre as a drop of piss in the wind?	JH	1	ボン、ハン	およ.そ、おうよ.そ、すべ.て	凡人 (ぼんじん), 凡百 (ぼんひゃく), 平凡 (へいぼん)
67	defeat	PHỤ (cậy tài khinh người gọi là tự phụ bất phàm)	負	defeat, bound up, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	9	4	Above we have the condensed form of bound up, and below the familiar shellfish. Now imagine two oysters engaged in shell-to-shell combat, the one who is defeated being bound and gagged with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The bound shellfish thus becomes the symbol for defeat.		Tied up, the shellfish had to accept defeat!	Defeat is defined by a shellfish in binds.	3	3	フ	ま.ける、ま.かす、お.う	負う (お.う), 負かす (ま.かす), 負ける (ま.ける)
68	ten thousand	VẠN (VẠN TUẾ: muôn năm)	万	ten thousand, one, ceiling, bound up	3	4	"Japanese counts higher numbers in units of ten thousand, unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read ""four ten-thousands"" by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to bind up a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for one and bound up naturally come to form ten thousand. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for bound up in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together."		I bound ten thousand dollars together and hid it under the floor.	"We have ""one"" at the top and if you turn the kanji 90 degrees you will see arabic 4 shich means it has four zeros in front of it!"	2	5	マン、バン	よろず	万一 (まんいち), 万年筆 (まんねんひつ), 巨万 (きょまん)
69	phrase	CÚ (Cú pháp)	句	phrase, bound up, mouth	5	4	By combining the two primitives bound up and mouth, we can easily see how this character can get the meaning of a phrase. After all, a phrase is nothing more than a number of words bound up tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your mouth.		Some Japanese CÚ are difficult to wrap your mouth around.	A bound mouth cannot utter a single phrase.	5	1	ク		句 (く)
70	texture	CƠ (Da, thịt trong da)	肌	texture, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, wind	6	4	"Ever notice how the texture of your face and hands is affected by the wind? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a part of the body gets exposed to the wind, its texture is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside texture connotes how something is ""to the touch."")"		When you expose your flesh to the wind it gets textured: goosebumps!	The moon´s lack of wind preserves its texture.	JH	2	キ	はだ	肌 (はだ)
71	decameron	Tuần (mười ngày gọi là một tuần, một tháng có ba tuần.)	旬	decameron, bound up, sun, day	6	4	There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block often days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, decameron, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten days taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people bound together for the days of the decameron.		If you bind up ten days, you get a decameron.	Hesig should be BOUND for a DAY (or maybe 10 days - a decameron) for calling this Kanji DECAMERON. See martyrdom (#809).	JH	1	ジュン、シュン		
72	ladle	CHƯỚC (Cái môi dùng để múc canh.)	勺	ladle, bound up, drop	3	4	If you want to bind up drops of anything - water, soup, lemonade - you use something to scoop these drops up, which is what we call a ladle. See the last drop left inside the ladle?		A ladle binds drops together.	Forget about the primative ´bound up´. Imagine instead the shape of a ladle and holding it upside down to drink the last DROP (of water).	Names	1	シャク		
73	bull´s eye	ĐÍCH (mục đích)	的	bull’s eye, white, dove, ladle, bound up, drop	8	4	"The elements white bird and ladle easily suggest the image of a bull's eye if you imagine a rusty old ladle with a bull's eye painted on it in the form of a tiny white bird, who lets out a little ""peep"" every time you hit the target."		I managed to hit the bull's eye by throwing my white ladle.	"A white, bound up, drop in the center is the bull´s eye. (why Heisig had to use ""ladle"" instead of the original two primitives that make up ""ladle"" I´ll never understand!)."	4		テキ	まと	的 (まと)
74	neck	THỦ (Đầu)	首	neck, horns, nose, one, ceiling, drop, eye	9	4	"Reading this kanji from the top down, we have: horns . . . nose. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great horns and long nose. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's ""head"" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its neck. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word neck conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g neck hanging over the fireplace, whose horns you use for a coat-rack and whose nose has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for horns: that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here."		The mooses neck supports it´s big horns and long nose.	The V shape is your neck on top of your collar bone, or the straight line. Yourself, or the rest of your body is below that!	2	3	シュ	くび	首 (くび)
75	fish guts	ẤT (ngư khử ất = cả bỏ ruột)	乙	fishguts, fishhook	1	5	"The kanji shown here actually represents the ""second"" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are ""pure,"" ""tasteful,"" ""quaint,"" and - get this! - fish guts. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word."	* We will keep fishhook as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow.	This is a fish hook, that pulls out the fishguts.	You cut a fish in a z shape on the belly to make it easier to open the fish and rip out its fish guts silly!	JH	1	オツ、イツ	おと-、きのと	
76	riot	LOẠN	乱	riot, tongue, thousand, drop, ten, needle, mouth, fishhook	7	5	"In a riot, manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a rioting tongue: it gets ""barbed"" like a fishhook, and sets to attacking the opposition, to hook them as it were."		The riot police broke up the riot by dragging the rioters away by their tongues with fishooks.	A tongue with a hook can cause a riot.	6	2	ラン、ロン	みだ.れる、みだ.る、みだ.す、みだ、おさ.める、わた.る	乱す (みだ.す), 乱れる (みだ.れる)
77	straightaway	TRỰC (ngay lập tức)	直	straightaway, ten, needle, eye, fishhook	8	5	Begin with the top two primitives, needle and eye. Together they represent the eye of a needle. Below them is a fishhook that has been straightened out and its barb removed so that it can pass through the eye of the needle.		If you get a needle in your eye that is hooked in there, get to a hospital straightaway.	I caught a freaky creature with ten eyes on my fish hook, so I threw it back straightaway.	2	3	チョク、ジキ、ジカ	ただ.ちに、なお.す、-なお.す、なお.る、なお.き、す.ぐ	直立 (ちょくりつ), 直接 (ちょくせつ), 実直 (じっちょく), 直ちに (ただ.ちに), 直す (なお.す), 直る (なお.る)
78	tool	CỤ (Công cụ)	具	tool, eye, tool, one, animal legs, eight	8	5	Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's tools of all sorts, each equipped with its own eye so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.		Keep an eye on your tools while you work at the table.	One tool nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench. It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.	3	3	グ	そな.える、つぶさ.に	
79	true	CHÂN (Chân lý)	真	true, ten, needle, eye, tool, one, animal legs, eight	10	5	Here again we meet the composite element, eye of the needle, which here combines with tool to give us a measure of what is true and what is not.		A compass is a tool with a needle on top that points to true north.	Ten tools are all a true craftsman needs.	3	4	シン	ま、ま-、まこと	真 (ま)
80	craft	CÔNG (công nghệ, công nhân)	工	craft, artificial	3	5	The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for craft in general.	* As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of craft and also takes on the related meanings of I beam and artificial.	I consider craft to be one of the harder primitives to use in stories so I´ve personified it as Bender the crafty robot from Futurama who was designed to bend I-beams.	I crafty.	2	4	コウ、ク、グ		工場 (こうじょう), 加工 (かこう), 人工 (じんこう)
81	left	Tả (tả hữu: trái, phải)	左	left, by one’s side, craft	5	5	"By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: by one's side . . . craft. Conveniently, the left has traditionally been considered the ""sinister"" side, where dark and occult crafts are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the left and is longer than the first."		The LEFT side of my brain posesses the faculties needed for logical crafts, like engineering.	The left side of my brain, is for crafts.	1	5	サ、シャ	ひだり	左 (ひだり)
82	right	Hữu (bên phải)	右	right, by one’s side, mouth	5	5	When thinking of the key word right, in order to avoid confusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double meaning here, too. Imagine a little mouth hanging down by your side - like a little voice of conscience - telling you the right thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the right and be drawn slightly longer than the first.		The right hand is for putting food in your mouth. (The other hand is for ass-wiping!).	Always keep your right to free speech (mouth) by your side!	1	5	ウ、ユウ	みぎ	右岸 (みぎぎし), 右折 (うせつ), 右派 (うは), 右 (みぎ)
83	possess	Hữu (sở hữu)	有	possess, by one’s side, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	6	5	The picture here is of someone with a slab of meat dangling by the side, perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in possession of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh meat to hang by one's side until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order.		By my side I POSSESS a moon of flesh, better known as your big ass!	Possessed by the Earth´s gravity, the moon stays by its side.	3	4	ユウ、ウ	あ.る	有益 (ゆうえき), 所有 (しょゆう), 特有 (とくゆう), 有 (ある)
84	bribe	Hối (hối lộ)	賄	bribe, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, possess, by one’s side, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	13	5	To the left we have the primitive for a shellfish, and to the right the kanji we just learned for possess. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word possess, and now expand your image of shells to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is possessed by shells is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to bribe with a few extra shells.		To bribe someone, money is a necessary possession.	If you possess enough shellfish, you can bribe anyone.	JH	1	ワイ	まかな.う	賄う (まかな.う)
85	tribute	Cống (cống hiến, cống nạp)	貢	tribute, craft, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	10	5	A tribute has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and money collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned money. Little wonder that this ancient craft of getting money by calling it a tribute has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax.		Tribute is the craft of raising money.	This next song is a TRIBUTE to a little SHELLFISH friend of mine who was tragically crushed by an I-shaped table..	JH	1	コウ、ク	みつ.ぐ	貢献 (こうけん), 貢 (みつぐ)
86	paragraph	Hạng	項	paragraph, craft, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	12	5	"To the right we see a head and to the left an element that means craft. When we think of a paragraph, we immediately think of a heading device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate heads often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's craft. Hence, we define paragraphing as the ""heading craft"" to remember this character."		To write a paragraph is the craft of grouping sentences on a page.	To craft a page well, we need paragraphs.	JH	1	コウ	うなじ	
87	sword	Đao	刀	sword, dagger	2	5	Although this character no longer looks very much like a sword, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the sword. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji.	* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a dagger. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing saber, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801).	This SWORD is so sharp, it can cut the top part of カ off in カタナ.	If you look really close this kanji looks like a person bending over touching the ground Waiting for someone to put there sword in his ass!	2	1	トウ	かたな、そり	刀 (かたな)
88	blade	Nhận (Mũi nhọn. Chém giết. Như thủ nhận: tự tay mình giết.)	刃	blade, drop, sword, dagger	3	5	Think of using a dagger as a razor blade, and it shouldn't be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little drop of blood clinging to the blade?		The part of a sword where a drop of blood can usually be found is the blade.	A drop of blood on the blade of my sword.	JH	1	ジン、ニン	は、やいば、き.る	刃 (は)
89	cut	Thiết (thiết thực, thân thiết)	切	cut, seven, diced, sword, dagger	4	5	To the right we see the dagger and next to it the number seven whose primitive meaning we decided would be diced (Frame 7). It is hard to think of cutting anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a dagger lying on the mantelpiece and starts dicing up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets....		The seven samurai used their swords to cut their opponents.	Seven swords cut better than one.	2	4	セツ、サイ	き.る、-き.る、き.り、-き.り、-ぎ.り、き.れる、-き.れる、き.れ、-き.れ、-ぎ.れ	切断 (せつだん), 親切 (しんせつ), 切に (せつに), 切る (き.る), 切れる (き.れる)
90	seduce	Triệu (Vời, lấy tay vẫy lại là triệu, lấy lời gọi lại là triệu.)	召	seduce, sword, dagger, mouth	5	5	"A sword or dagger posed over a mouth is how the character for ""beckoning"" is written. The related but less tame key word seduce was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is seducing the small round one or vice versa.)"	* The primitive meaning remains the same: seduce. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.	"A man is easily seduced by a mouth to his ""sword.""."	To seduce is to make a sword of one´s mouth.	JH	2	ショウ	め.す	召す (め.す)
91	shining	Chiêu (Sáng sủa, rõ rệt. Như chiêu chương: rõ rệt.)	昭	shining, sun, day, seduce, summon, sword, dagger, mouth	9	5	Let the key word suggest shining one's shoes, the purpose of which is to seduce the sun down on them for all to see.		Shining is the sun´s seduction.	The sun was shining so bright that it seduced Icarus and he flew too close.	3	1	ショウ		
92	rule	Tắc (phép tắc)	則	rule, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, sword, sabre, saber	9	5	The character depicts a clam alongside a great and flashing saber. Think of digging for clams in an area where there are gaming rules governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty saber, which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a clam and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the rules say it has to be.		When you have both money and the power of the sword, you can make the rules.	If you´ve got CRABs on your SABER, then you didn´t follow the rules of safe sex!	5	2	ソク	のっと.る	
93	vice-	PHÓ	副	vice-, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains, sword, sabre, saber	11	5	The key word vice has the sense of someone second-in-command. The great and flashing saber to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the wealth on the left combine to create an image of dividing one's property to give a share to one's vice-wealth holder.		The wealthy guy with the sword standing next to the king, that´s the vice-roy who does all the dirty work.	Vice-president Cheney: a wealthy saber rattler.	4	2	フク		
94	separate	Biệt	別	separate, mouth, bound up, sword, sabre, saber	7	5	In the Old East, the samurai and his saber were never separated. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of separation-anxiety for a samurai: to be bound up with a rope and unable to get at his saber leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that mouth bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for tied up is written - just as it had been with the character for ten thousand.		I don´t know about you but to me this seems like someone´s head is about to be separated from his body. You can see he´s kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take.	A wise old samurai keeps his hostages (with their mouths bound up to keep them quiet) in a separate room from his sabers. Putting them together would be a silly mistake.	4	4	ベツ	わか.れる、わ.ける	別れる (わか.れる)
95	street	Đinh	丁	street, street, nail, spike	2	5	The picture here is of a street sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any street that immediately conjure sup the image of a street sign to you.	* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a nail or a spike. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a street sign out of the ground and using it as a nail to repair your garage roof.	Two streets make a T-intersection.	"Today, the program ""Sesame Street"" is brought to you by the letter ""T""."	3	1	チョウ、テイ、チン、トウ、チ	ひのと	丁数 (ちょうかず), 落丁 (らくちょう), 二丁目 (にちょうめ)
96	village	Đinh	町	village, rice field, brains, street, nail, spike	7	5	Street signs standing at the corner of the rice fields depict the village limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.)		Actually this means town, like one that has lots of streets and is surrounded by all the rice fields.	"Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. ""Pillage the village, for the rice and and the tea."" the street primitive on the right looks like a ´t´."	1	4	チョウ	まち	町 (まち)
97	can	Khả, khắc	可	can, mouth, street, street, nail, spike	5	5	"Remember the story about the ""Little Engine that Could"" when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain - ""I think I can, I think I can...."" - spitting railroad spikes out of its mouth as it chews up the line to the top."		I can eat nails.	"A mouth on the street asking for things: ""Can I get some help?! Can I get directions, Can I have some money? Can you please speak English?!""."	5		カ、コク	-べ.き	
98	place on the head	Đính (đỉnh đầu)	頂	place on the head, street, nail, spike, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	11	5	"The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning ""humble acceptance."" Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: nail . . . head. As in ""hitting the nail on the head."" Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to place on your head a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment."		If I put a street sign on my head what do I get ? A place on the head !	NAILS - place directly on the forehead, NAILS - place directly on the forehead, NAILS - place directly on the forehead, 　　　The HEAD ON commercial nails it into your head......	6	3	チョウ	いただ.く、いただき	頂く (いただ.く), 頂 (いただき)
99	child	TỬ,TÝ (phần tử, nguyên tử, mẫu tử, tử tôn)	子	child	3	6	This kanji is a pictograph of a child wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young children who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.	* As a primitive, the meaning of child is retained, though you might imagine a little older child, able to run around and get into more mischief.	A child who is ten will still ask for his ma (top looks a bit like katakana ma).	A pictograph of a child, with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?). Note that this kanji occupies the first space on the Zodiac circle, and is the sign for the rat (such as 2008!).	1	5	シ、ス、ツ	こ、-こ、ね	子孫 (しそん), 女子 (じょし), 帽子 (ぼうし), 子 (こ)
100	cavity	KHỔNG (Lỗ. Như tỵ khổng: lỗ mũi)	孔	cavity, child, fishhook	4	6	"Probably the one thing most children fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a child has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word cavity, even though it is not likely to know that the word means ""hole"" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny hooks the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back."		The child´s arms flailed around at the sight of the hooked tool the dentist was going to use to fill his cavity.	I warned him about cavities, but the child is still hooked on sweets.	JH	1	コウ	あな	
101	complete	"LIỄU (Xong, như ""liễu sự"": xong việc.)"	了	complete, child with arms wrapped up	2	6	"Learn this character by returning to frame 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the ""arms"" have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a child with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully completed."		The experiment was a complete failure! The child was made without any arms!	A child with the arms inside the blanket will be completely wrapped up.	JH	2	リョウ		
102	woman	NỮ	女	woman	3	6	You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting woman drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing.	* The primitive meaning is the same: woman.	"To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a ""kunoichi"". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一(kanji, ichi=one)."	My mother taught me that a woman should always sit with her legs crossed (but the arms can be stretched out).	1	5	ジョ、ニョ、ニョウ	おんな、め	女子 (じょし), 女流 (じょりゅう), 少女 (しょうじょ), 女人 (にょにん), 天女 (てんにょ), 善男善女 (ぜんなんぜんにょ), 女 (おんな), 女 (め)
103	fond	HIẾU,HẢO (Hiếu học)	好	fond, woman, child	6	6	"The phrase ""to be fond of someone"" has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term ""to fondle."" The character likens it to a woman fondling her child."		A woman is fond of her child.	"Jane Fonda carrying a Vietnamese child. Pro-war protesters hold signs, ""I´m not fonda Jane!""...　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　コウ　好評　こうひょう(favorable criticism)."	4	3	コウ	この.む、す.く、よ.い、い.い	好む (この.む), 好く (す.く)
104	likeness	NHƯ (Bằng, cùng. Dùng để so sánh. Như ái nhân như kỉ: yêu người như yêu mình.)	如	likeness, woman, mouth	6	6	Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the mouth of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a woman gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a likeness to the opening of the woman from whom you were born.		Women share a common likeness. Their mouths are always open, whining about this and that.	From a woman´s other 口comes a baby with a perfect likeness.	JH	1	ジョ、ニョ	ごと.し	欠如 (けつじょ), 突如 (とつじょ), 躍如 (やくじょ)
105	mama	MẪU	母	mama, mother, breasts	5	6	Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for woman in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a mama. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.	* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of breasts in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.	The two breasts of a momma who breastfeeds.	This mama had twins, one mouth for each nipple.	2	5	ボ	はは、も	母 (はは)
106	pierce	QUÁN (Suốt thông, xâu qua. Như quán châu: xâu hạt châu)	貫	pierce, mama, mother, breasts, oyster, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	11	6	If one is asked to think of associations for the word pierce, among the first to come to mind is that of piercing one's ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: mama . . . oyster. All you need to do is imagine piercing an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl (actually, a mama-of-pearl) you have just wrested from an oyster.		The sad fate of Mama shellfish was to be captured and pierced to make an earring.	Ariel the Little Mermaid´s clamshell bra was held to her breasts by piercings.	JH	1	カン	つらぬ.く、ぬ.く、ぬき	貫く (つらぬ.く)
107	elder brother	HUYNH	兄	elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs	5	6	"By now kanji like this one should ""look like"" something to you even though it is more of an ""ideogram"" than a ""pictograph."" The large mouth on top and the human legs below almost jump off the page as a caricature of elder brother, the one with the big mouth (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who ""has the say"" among all the children)."	* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of teenager, in accord with the familiar image of the big mouth and the gangling, clumsy legs.	Mother, why is elder brother´s mouth between the neighbor girl´s legs? RTK2:　ケイ　父兄　ふけい　(father and elder brother)　　　　　　　　　キョウ　兄弟　きょうだい(brothers)…　　　　　　　　　　　　　MIXED GROUP:　(ｺｸ): 克104　(ｷｮｳ): 況145　競434　(ｼｭｸ): 祝1089.	My elder brother was basically a mouth on legs when he was a teenager.	2	4	ケイ、キョウ	あに	兄事 (あにこと), 父兄 (ふけい), 義兄 (ぎあに), 兄 (あに)
109	overcome	KHẮC (Dược, đánh được gọi là khắc. Như khắc phục)	克	overcome, ten, needle, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs	7	6	"In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of teenager. The needle on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the teenager growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the needle at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that ""We Shall Overcome"" the plague, will the needle cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character."		Ten elder brothers can overcome anything.	A teenager addicted to heroine must overcome the needle.	JH	1	コク	か.つ	
110	little	TIỂU (tiểu đội)	小	little, small	3	7	"The sense of little that this character represents is not the same as ""a little bit."" That meaning comes in the next frame. Here little means ""small"" or ""tiny."" The image is one of three little drops, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: little, little, nothing but little."	* The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards.	A little penguin with its wings at its side.	A depressed child, head low and arms hung low, because he´s too little to ride the roller coaster.	1	5	ショウ	ちい.さい、こ-、お-、さ-	小 (お), 小 (こ), 小さい (ちい.さい)
111	few	THIẾU,THIỂU (thiểu năng)	少	few, little, small, drop	4	7	First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the drop at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny drop indicate a further belittling of what is already little - thus making it a few of something little.		Only a few people can make an ugly face like that.	Few usually refers to three. To emphasize three, we underline the three drops in little.	2	4	ショウ	すく.ない、すこ.し	少ない (すく.ない), 少し (すこ.し)
112	large	ĐẠI	大	large, St. Bernard	3	7	Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of large. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms.	* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a large dog or, if you prefer, a St. Bernard dog. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made.	A person stretching their arms and legs to look large and scare a bear away.	Think of a large St. Bernard dog with his paws all stretched out.	1	5	ダイ、タイ	おお-、おお.きい、-おお.いに	大小 (だいしょう), 大胆 (だいたん), 拡大 (かくだい), 大 (おお), 大いに (おお.いに), 大きい (おお.きい)
113	many	ĐA (đa số)	多	many, evening, evening2	6	7	"""Many moons ago,"" begins much of Amerindian folklore - a colorful way of saying ""Once upon a time"" and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two moons (three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time."		Two evenings too many!	"This reminds me of a childish pseudo-confucion rhyme: ""He who eats many prunes sits on toilet many moons""."	2	4	タ	おお.い、まさ.に、まさ.る	多い (おお.い)
114	evening	TỊCH (Buổi tối.)	夕	evening	3	7	"Just as the word evening adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word ""night,"" so the kanji for evening takes the ordinary looking moon in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame)."	* The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.	The evening is young, the moon is not full.	"In the evening, I try my best to remember the katakana symbol for ""TA"" (ie. ""ta ta!"")."	1	4	セキ	ゆう	夕 (ゆう)
115	eventide	TỊCH (Nước thủy triều buổi tối.)	汐	eventide, water, water droplets, water pistol, evening	6	7	In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning-tide and the element for drops of water. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, eventide: drops of water inching their way up the shore in the evening.		Eventide is just another word for evening, and it has the word tide in it which we associate with water.	Drops of water shower the beach as the evening tide approaches: eventide.	Names	1	セキ	しお、うしお、せい	
116	outside	NGOẠI (ngoại ngữ)	外	outside, evening, magic wand, augury	5	7	On the left, the primitive for evening, and on the right, that for the magic wand. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your magic wand out into the evening air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, evening and magic wand takes you naturally outside.		A young magician likes to practice outside in the evening with his magic wand (as opposed to the old magician who wakes early to practice with his wand in eminent (#51)).	Outside in the dark of evening, only a magic wand can help you.	2	5	ガイ、ゲ	そと、ほか、はず.す、はず.れる、と-	外出 (がいしゅつ), 海外 (かいがい), 除外 (じょがい), 外 (そと), 外す (はず.す), 外れる (はず.れる), 外 (ほか)
117	name	DANH (danh bất hư truyền)	名	name, evening, mouth	6	7	Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into its ear the name he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive naming custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: evening . . . mouth. At evening time, a mouth pronounces the name that will accompany one throughout life.		In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your name so that people can recognise you.	In the evening, her sweet mouth whispered my name.	1	5	メイ、ミョウ	な、-な	名誉 (めいよ), 氏名 (しめい), 有名 (ゆうめい), 名 (な)
118	stone	THẠCH (đá thạch anh)	石	stone, cliff, mouth	5	7	With a mouth under a cliff, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great stone has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the Arabian Nights should be enough to push the stone aside. But take care - the cliff is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in cliff will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.	* The stone is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of stones or rocks of any size or shape.	Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of cliff just in time to evade the huge STONE rolling out of the mouth of the cave!	There´s a VERY simple way to remember this, in case the cliff thing isn´t working for you... Just see it as a stone [いし] being hammered by a miner searching for jewel stones [ほうせき] ;).	1	3	セキ、シャク、コク	いし	石材 (せきざい), 岩石 (がんせき), 宝石 (ほうせき), 磁石 (じしゃく), 石 (いし)
119	resemblance	TIÊU (Giống)	肖	resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	7	7	"The word resemblance should suggest, among other things, a son's resemblance to his father. A ""chip off the old block"" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a little bit of flesh."	* When used as a primitive, the sense of resemblance is replaced by that of spark or candle. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for moon also carries a secondary sense of fire, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)	It doesn't hold a candle to the real thing. They share a resemblance at most.	Using DNA matching, a very little bit of flesh can be used to show the resemblence between family members.	JH	1	ショウ	あやか.る	
120	nitrate	TIÊU (Dá tiêu. Chất trong suốt, đốt cháy dữ, dùng làm thuốc súng thuốc pháo và nấu thủy tinh.)	硝	nitrate, stone, rock, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	12	7	The word nitrate should immediately suggest a beaker of nitric acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a rock and watching the sparks fly as it bores a hole through the rock.		That stone has sparks coming out of it! Someone must have poured nitrate acid on it.	"Salpetre is the common name for Nitrate coming from Latin ""sal petrae"" or stone salt. It is also a component of gun powder so including a candle in this kanji can be quite explosive!"	JH	1	ショウ		
121	smash	TOÁI (toái thạch: đá vụn)	砕	smash, stone, rock, ninety, nine, baseball, ten, needle	9	7	We begin with the two elements on the right, baseball and needle. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a game of cricket in which a needle is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a rock for a ball. A smash hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a smashing pitch would do the same with the needle wicket.		To SMASH a STONE you need to hit it NINE or TEN times.	The Stones (the Rolling Stones) are 90 aged but they´ve done a new SMASH hit!	JH	1	サイ	くだ.く、くだ.ける	砕く (くだ.く), 砕ける (くだ.ける)
122	sand	SA (sa mạc)	砂	sand, stone, rock, few	9	7	Good sand for beaches has few or no stones in it. That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don't have to watch our step as we cavort about.		Here´s how I remember that stone is on the left. This is because sand starts as stones, and only later they become few.	In good SAND, stones are few, if any.	6	2	サ、シャ	すな	砂丘 (さきゅう), 砂糖 (さとう), 砂 (すな)
124	plane	TƯỚC (tước vỏ)	削	plane, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber	9	7	Long before the invention of the carpenter's plane, people used knives and machetes (or here, sabers) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can plane a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the sparks fly from their sabers.		Sparks will fly if you attempt to PLANE your sabre.	With today´s strict air regulations, carrying a sabre onto a plane could spark quite a commotion.	JH	1	サク	けず.る、はつ.る、そ.ぐ	削る (けず.る)
125	ray	QUANG	光	ray, small, little, human legs	6	7	"There are really only 2 primitives here, little and human legs. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of ""dust"" are that dance around in the light-rays that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as little and disembodied human legs, and you should have no trouble with this character."		A ray of light is not a wave but made of little photons with human legs.	The ray from Honey I Shrunk the Kids made people little - ha! look at them run around on their tiny legs!	2	3	コウ	ひか.る、ひかり	光る (ひか.る), 光 (ひかり)
126	plump	THÁI (thái tự: kiểu chữ đậm)	太	plump, large, St. Bernard, drop	4	7	"""Plump"" is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample-bodied person falling into a sofa like a large drop of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr-plump!"		A large person with a big drop of sweat dripping off of him because he is so plump.	"Fat(""plump"") men always have small penises.....the kanji is a combination of ""large"" with a drop(representing the small penis between his legs)."	2	3	タイ、タ	ふと.い、ふと.る	太陽 (たいよう), 太鼓 (たいこ), 皇太子 (こうたいし), 太い (ふと.い), 太る (ふと.る)
127	utensil	KHÍ (Đồ. Như khí dụng: đồ dùng)	器	utensil, mouth, large, St. Bernard, mouth4	15	7	The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy St. Bernard dog stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty mouth, waiting for the utensils to arrive so the feast can begin.		Imagine four hungry mouths all sitting around the table. They are all banging their utensils on the table waiting for a big meal to be placed in the centre.	"Note: 器 by itself means container/caliber/vessel. And 食器 means eating utensils (""food container"", hehe)."	4	1	キ	うつわ	器 (うつわ)
128	stinking	XÚ (Mùi.)	臭	stinking, nose, drop, eye, large, St. Bernard	9	7	This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world. Our friend the St. Bernard is alive and well, its nose in the air sniffing suspiciously after something stinking somewhere or other.		The ST. BERNARD DOG lifted his large NOSE high in the air to find out where the stinking smell comes from.	When I is big, Ego stinking.	JH	1	シュウ	くさ.い、-くさ.い、にお.う、にお.い	臭い (くさ.い)
130	exquisite	DIỆU (Khéo, hay, thần diệu lắm. Tinh thần khéo léo mầu nhiệm không thể nghĩ nghị được gọi là diệu. Tuổi trẻ gọi là diệu niên)	妙	exquisite, woman, few	7	7	"The primitive for woman is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for few. When we refer to a woman as exquisite, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but few and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word exquisite carries this same sense of ""seeking out"" the rare from the ordinary."		Exquisite women are few and far between.	A geisha is an exquisite and delicate (another meaning of this kanji) women, however, even in the past there was only few of them.	JH	1	ミョウ、ビョウ	たえ	
131	focus	TỈNH (tỉnh lại)	省	focus, few, eye	9	7	When we think of focusing on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our eye on a few important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a few things and holding them before one's eye in order to focus on them better.		You focus by concentrating your eye on fewer objects.	Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: focus on a few nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your eyes ---(I have trouble with this few primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).	4	2	セイ、ショウ	かえり.みる、はぶ.く	反省 (はんせい), 内省 (ないせい), 帰省 (きせい), 省みる (かえり.みる), 省く (はぶ.く)
132	thick	HẬU (Chiều dầy.)	厚	thick, cliff, sun, day, child	9	7	When we refer to someone as thick-skinned or thick-headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for thick depicts a child abandoned out on the wild cliffs, exposed to the heat of the sun, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as thick as the parent who left it there.		In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff. Under the Sun, they fight other Children. In the end, if they survive, they sure have thick skin.	The thick cliff walls protected the children from the sun.	5	2	コウ	あつ.い、あか	厚い (あつ.い)
133	strange	KỲ (kỳ lạ)	奇	strange, large, St. Bernard, can, mouth, street, nail, spike	8	7	"The elements we are given to work with here are St. Bernard dog and can. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word can. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along) to stick closely to the elements, in this case, mouth and nails. Now all we need do is create a fictitious ""Strange But True"" column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a St. Bernard whose mouth has been nailed shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard."		I find it strange that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.	Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How strange!	JH	1	キ	く.しき、あや.しい、くし、めずら.しい	
134	stream	XUYÊN. Nước trong núi dũa đất chảy ra gọi là xuyên. Nước chảy không lúc nào ngừng là thường xuyên.	川	stream, flood	3	8	We have taken the image of a river stream over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a stream.	* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of stream the more vivid image of a flood. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the same. on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook	So as not to confuse this with river (#146) think of streamers falling down.	There are three default I/O Streams in UNIX, stdin, stdout, and stderr.	1	5	セン	かわ	川 (かわ)
135	state	CHÂU, ngày xưa nhân thấy có núi cao sông dài mới chia đất ra từng khu lấy núi sông làm mốc nên gọi là châu.	州	state, stream, flood, drops	6	8	Here we see drops of land (little islets) rising up out of a stream, creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the state-line is drawn between states separated by a river? If there were little drops of land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.		There were 3 little islands in the stream who all decided to set themselves up as independent states.	"シュウ　The original meaning of this character was ""sandbar"", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American states. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by state after state as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars."	3	2	シュウ、ス	す	州 (す)
136	obey	THUẬN (Hoà thuận)	順	obey, stream, flood, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	12	8	"In primitive language, this character would read stream . . . head. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of obey. Either one obeys the person who is head of an organization or else obeys by following the stream of opinion (""current"" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji."		Obey, Obey! says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a stream of orders to fill your head.	Obey the orders streaming down from head office.	4	2	ジュン		
137	water	THUỶ	水	water	4	8	This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of water - not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.	* As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.	The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig´s story doesn´t do this).	"For those having issues with this* ""A 7K foot pool of water"" Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times."	1	5	スイ	みず、みず-	水 (みず)
138	icicle	Băng	氷	icicle, drop, water	5	8	The appearance of the primitive for water in its full form tells us that we have something to do with water here. The extra drop to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a walking stick dropped into water to form an icicle. If it helps, when you hold an icicle up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji.		Icicles start with 1 frozen drop of water. (I kept mistaking this with 'eternity') So Iciles start with one drop (drop down) of water	A drop in temperature turns water into an icicle.	3	2	ヒョウ	こおり、ひ、こお.る	氷 (こおり), 氷 (ひ)
139	eternity	Vĩnh (vĩnh viễn)	永	eternity, drop, water	5	8	"This kanji also uses the full form of water, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with water. Remember what William Blake said about seeing ""infinity in a grain of sand and eternity in an hour""? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see ""eternity in a drop of water."""		It would take an eternity to count all the drops of water.	It takes but one drop from the most special water: the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an eternity. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).	5	2	エイ	なが.い	永い (なが.い)
140	spring	TUYỀN, TOÀN (suối, nguồn)	泉	spring, white, dove, water	9	8	"Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling spring of water, and you will probably notice how the top of the spring you are thinking of, the part where the ""bubbling"" goes on, is all white. Happily, the white is just where it should be, at the top, and the water is at the bottom."	* We will keep this image of a spring when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for water) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for little.	White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water.	Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot spring: a little white towel on top, water below. (This helps keep all associations: spring, little and onsen).	6	2	セン	いずみ	泉 (いずみ)
142	meadow	NGUYÊN. Cánh đồng. Chỗ đất bằng phẳng gọi là nguyên. Như bình nguyên: đồng bằng, cao nguyên: đồng cao, v.v. Nơi đất ở giữa cả nước gọi là trung nguyên .	原	meadow, cliff, spring, white, dove, small, little	10	8	"Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the meadow you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain meadow in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of ""The Sound of Music"" will help.) Simply think of little springs bubbling up across the meadow to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous cliff. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the springs, and then falling headlong over the cliff, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory."		"Forget about ""spring"" because the water primitive is abbreviated to ""little"". This is easy to forget by the time you've finished RTK1. Instead, imagine standing on an exceedingly high cliff. Not overlooking the sea, but overlooking meadows. And what on earth are those white little things? Wow, they're sheep! This cliff must be really high!"	Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji meadow, used in composite words the most common meaning is ORIGIN... To remember just think that life may have begun in pounds or springs in a land with many cliffs ... Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of meadow as the origin of a huge forest.	2	3	ゲン	はら	原 (はら)
143	petition	NGUYỆN. Muốn. Lòng mong cầu gọi là tâm nguyện	願	petition, meadow, cliff, white, dove, small, little, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	19	8	A meadow and a head are all we are given to work with in the kanji for petition. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz head located in the middle of the flowery meadow we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, petitioning for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?)		Let´s petition to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE.	"Japanese hippies PETITION to save a meadow by getting people on the street to sign their page - as you pass by they call out: ""お願いします、おねがいします。”."	4	3	ガン	ねが.う、-ねがい	願う (ねが.う)
144	swim	VỊNH. Lặn, đi ngầm dưới đáy nước.	泳	swim, water, water droplets, water pistol, eternity	8	8	The primitive to the left, you will recall from Frame 137, represents water. To the right, we see the kanji for eternity. Knowing how much children like swimming, what could be a better image of eternal bliss than an endless expanse of water to swim in without a care in the world?		With that much WATER (2 actually) you would need to swim for an ETERNITY.	If you don´t know how to swim, you´ll be in that water for eternity.	3	3	エイ	およ.ぐ	泳ぐ (およ.ぐ)
145	marsh	CHIỂU. Cái ao hình cong	沼	marsh, water, water droplets, water pistol, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth	8	8	Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the marshlands are low and near a source of water that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes marshy is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to seduce the water over to its side. But, like most inordinate seductions, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy marsh.		The marshlands near Mordor seduce Frodo into gazing upon them, and he falls into the water--splash!	A marsh is where water is seduced into the ground.	JH	1	ショウ	ぬま	沼 (ぬま)
146	open sea	TRÙNG	沖	open sea, water, water droplets, water pistol, in, stick, mouth	7	8	"This kanji could hardly be simpler. The key word open sea readily suggests being out in the middle of a great body of water .Thinking of it in this way should avoid confusion with the kanji for ""open,"" which we will meet later on."		Open sea is a lot of water in the middle of nowhere.	Water in the middle of the ocean is referred to as open sea.	JH	1	チュウ	おき、おきつ、ちゅう.する、わく	沖 (おき)
148	creek	GIANG	江	creek, water, water droplets, water pistol, craft	6	8	Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the creek is often no more then a dribble of water trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of water is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how creeks are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of water somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The creek is thus a lesson in water-craft, as this kanji would agree.		A CREEK is a small trail of water easily crafted with a stick.	Creeks are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.	JH	1	コウ	え	江 (え)
150	soup	TRẤP. Nước, nhựa. Vật gì có nước lỏng chảy ra gọi là trấp.	汁	soup, water, water droplets, water pistol, ten, needle	5	8	"To make soup, one begins with water and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick soup or stew called ""seven-in-one"" is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a ten-ingredient soup."		To make soup you just take water and add (+) the rest of your ingredients.	To make soup you just take water and add ten tasty ingredients.	JH	1	ジュウ	しる、-しる、つゆ	汁 (しる)
152	tide	TRIỀU (Thuỷ triều)	潮	tide, water, water droplets, water pistol, morning , mist, ten, needle, early, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, ten2, needle2	15	8	Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the water - that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for morning learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word tide, just think of it in connection with the character for eventide that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the morning-tide, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.		The morning tide is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.	This is not the eventide, but the water of the morning tide.	6	1	チョウ	しお、うしお	潮 (しお)
153	source	NGUYÊN (nguồn nước)	源	source, water, water droplets, water pistol, meadow, cliff, sun, day, small, little	13	8	"With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see water and meadow in this character for source. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word ""surge"") and in popular usage, source suggests the place water comes from. In this kanji, it is under the meadow, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little springs."		The water that flows from the meadow is the source of life for the wild antelope.	The source of clean water is from the meadow (#134): it comes from that spring at the bottom of the cliff. Pay no attention to Julie Andrews lying face down in spring. The water´s clean. Trust me.	6	1	ゲン	みなもと	源 (みなもと)
154	lively	HOẠT (Sinh hoạt)	活	lively, water, water droplets, water pistol, tongue, drop, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	9	8	When we speak of a lively personality or a lively party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of lively by having tongues babble and splash around like flowing water.		"Conversations can become more lively after everyone has had a few drinks. It´s because ""watery tongues"" loosen lips!"	I´m sure I can get her pretty lively and wet using my tongue.	2	3	カツ	い.きる、い.かす、い.ける	
155	extinguish	TIÊU (Tiêu hoá)	消	extinguish, water, water droplets, water pistol, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	10	8	Among the many things water is useful for is extinguishing fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the water at the left as the drops of water that are used to depict water in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to extinguish a fire would be to see that each drop of water hits one spark of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives.		To extinguish a SPARK, you need WATER.	You need a few drops of water to extinguish the candle.	3	3	ショウ	き.える、け.す	消える (き.える), 消す (け.す)
156	but of course	HUỐNG. Phương chi, huống hồ, dùng làm chữ giúp lời. Như hà huống, huống chi.	況	but of course, water, water droplets, water pistol, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs	8	8	"This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase but of course. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a teenager, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. ""Did you have a good shower?"" ""But of course,"" you reply, annoyed. So water and teenager combine to give us but of course."		"If you ask your teenager if what he´s drinking is water (and not Vodka), he will answer ""but of course""."	"キョウ But of course, this character really means ""situation/condition"". ""Elder brother gulped some water and said, ´What the hell was Heisig´s mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION. But of course, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, water quaffing, situation assessing, sober elder brother), his SITUATION may improve.´""　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況　(じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions]."	JH	2	キョウ	まし.て、いわ.んや、おもむき	
157	river	Hà	河	river, water, water droplets, water pistol, can, street, nail, spike, mouth	8	8	"The character in this frame represents a step up from the stream we met in Frame 134; it is a full-sized river. The water to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the can at the right tells us that our ""little engine that could"" has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat."		A river CAN exist only if there is WATER.	I kept confusing this with stream. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial river. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow River in China (黄河), and the other is the Milky Way (銀河). Now I either think of the Little Engine that could dragging a bunch of stuff down a river in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.	5	2	カ	かわ	河 (かわ)
158	overnight	BẠC. Phàm đỗ nghỉ vào đâu đều gọi là bạc. Như phiêu bạc.	泊	overnight, water, water droplets, water pistol, white, dove	8	8	When you stop at an inn for an overnight rest, all you expect is a bit of water for a wash and a set of clean white sheets to wrap your weary bones in.		Please supply a guest who stays overnight with WATER and WHITE sheets.	When I go to an OVERNIGHT party, all I need is a bit of water and some of that hard white. (crack). (not really, but come on. much easier to recall than white sheets).	JH	2	ハク	と.まる、と.める	泊まる (と.まる), 泊める (と.める)
159	lake	HỒ	湖	lake, water, water droplets, water pistol, uncivilized, zombie, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	12	8	Water . . . old . . . flesh. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the waters of a stormy lake because their flesh had gotten too old to bear the burdens of life.		This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the lake and looking at the MOON reflected in the lake. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji.	Water reflects the old moon in the lake.	3	2	コ	みずうみ	湖 (みずうみ)
160	fathom	TRẮC (Đo chiều sâu, nói rộng ra phàm sự đo lường đều gọi là trắc cả. Như bất trắc: không lường được.)	測	fathom, water, water droplets, water pistol, rule, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, sword, sabre, saber	12	8	"Connoting the measurement of the depth of water, the keyword fathom begins with the water primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for rule (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a ""ruler"" or ""measure."" Hence, when we rule water we fathom it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself fathoming a body of water several hundred feet deep by using a ruler of gargantuan proportions."		A fathom is the unit you use when making rules about water´s depth.	You can´t fathom how deep this water is. Perhaps you should use a ruler to measure it?	5	2	ソク	はか.る	測る (はか.る)
161	soil	THỔ, ĐỘ, ĐỖ	土	soil, dirt, ground	3	8	I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of soil piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.	* As a primitive, the sense of soil is extended to that of ground because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of dirt and land.	Remembering soil is easy. If soil is soft, you can take a walking stick and plunge it two* feet into the ground.	King Arthur pulled the magical sword Excalibur out of the hardened soil to claim his place as king.	1	5	ド、ト	つち	土木 (どぼく), 国土 (こくど), 粘土 (ねんど), 土 (つち)
162	spit	THỔ (Thổ ra, thổ lộ)	吐	spit, mouth, soil, dirt, ground	6	8	We have here a rather small mouth (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of dirt. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a mouth full of dirt. As least I know what I would do: spit it out as fast and far as I could!		The only things that come out of my MOUTH and onto the GROUND are spit and vomit. Everything else (words, song) floats on the air.	SPIT goes from my MOUTH to the GROUND.	JH	1	ト	は.く、つ.く	吐く (は.く)
163	PRESSURE	ÁP	圧	pressure, cliff, soil, dirt, ground	5	8	One of the things that causes the erosion of soil is the excessive pressure of the topsoil on the lower soil. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep cliff without a tree in sight. The slightest pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.		The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous pressure.	For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.	5	2	アツ、エン、オウ	お.す、へ.す、おさ.える、お.さえる	
164	cape	KÌ (Mũi đất (nhô ra biển))	埼	cape, soil, dirt, ground, strange, large, St. Bernard, street, nail, spike, mouth	11	8	The cape pictured here is a jut of land like Cape Cod. The soil on the left tells us we have to do with land, and the strange on the right tells us it is a cape where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of Cape Strange (or, if you prefer, Cape Odd).		This refers to LAND, not the STRANGE gear superheroes wear.	"Cape Cod ""odd"" is a land where odd=strange things happen."	JH		キ	さき、さい、みさき	埼 (さい)
165	hedge	VIÊN (Tường thấp, sở quan)	垣	hedge, soil, dirt, ground, span, one, ceiling, sun, day, one, floor, one	9	8	The hedge depicted in this frame is the miraculous hedge of briar roses that completely spanned the castle grounds in which Sleeping Beauty lay for a hundred years, so that none but her predestined beloved could find his way through it.		Before the Great Wall of China, there was a dirt hedge that spanned across.	The HEDGE of roses growing from the castle grounds fully spanned the castle walls.	JH	1	エン	かき	垣 (かき)
167	squared jewel	KHUÊ (Ngọc khuê)	圭	square jewel, ivy, soil, dirt, ground, soil2, dirt2, ground2	6	8	Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, square jewel, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of soil on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays.	"* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean ivy, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the ground to form a sort of ""second"" ground that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping."	Piling SOIL upon SOIL for aeons is how SQUARE JEWELS are formed deep in the earth.	How would you stop someone stealing your biggest square jewel? Bury it deep in the soil under ground. Then plant ivy to mark the spot.	Names	1	ケイ、ケ		
168	seal	PHONG (Phong ấn)	封	seal, ivy, square jewel, soil, dirt, ground, glue, soil2, dirt2, ground2	9	8	Think of the key word seal as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax seal, you glue a sprig of ivy on the outside. In this way the elements ivy and glue give you a curious and memorable way to seal your secret letters.		The king used a special seal of ivy leaves glued onto his document.	A bit of ivy glued to a letter can make a lovely SEAL when in a pinch, says Martha Stewart.	JH	2	フウ、ホウ		封鎖 (ふうさ), 封書 (ふうしょ), 密封 (みっぷう)
169	horizon	NHAI (Bờ bến. Cái gì vô cùng vô tận gọi là vô nhai)	涯	horizon, water, water droplets, water pistol, cliff, ivy, square jewel, soil, dirt, ground, soil2, dirt2, ground2	11	8	"After seeing a constant horizon of water, water everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the ivy-clad cliffs of land on a new horizon? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact ivy, but the phrase ""ivy-clad cliffs"" has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details."		Try to reverse Heisig´s story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant horizon is nothing but water.	From the water, I can see the ivy-clad-cliffs on the horizon.	JH	1	ガイ	はて	
170	Buddhist temple	TỰ (Chùa, chỗ sư ở)	寺	buddhist temple, soil, dirt, ground, glue	6	8	"You have heard of people ""attaching"" themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a Buddhist temple with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused land around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with glue, steps down firmly, and so joins the Buddhist temple as a ""permanent member."""		At the Buddhist temple the monks are seated on the ground, glued there in meditation.	To be allowed to join the Buddhist temple, imagine an aspiring monk being asked to stand still in the soil for a long time in a measurement of his resolve.	2	2	ジ	てら	寺 (てら)
171	time	THỜI (Thời gian)	時	time, sun, day, Buddhist temple, soil, dirt, ground, glue	10	8	"""What is time?"" asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. ""Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you."" Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. Time is a sun rising over a Buddhist temple. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character."		When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it´s time to get up.	In ancient Japan, TIME of ´´day´´ was announced at the ´´buddhist temples´´. They did this by ringing large iron bells. This is similar to churches who ring their bells to announce the time of day.	2	5	ジ	とき、-どき	時 (とき)
172	level	QUÂN (Quân tử)	均	level, soil, dirt, ground, ladle, drop, drop2	7	8	The level this key word refers to is not the carpenter's tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures soil being scooped up into a ladle and then made level (apparently because one is measuring soil). The excess drops of soil are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added drop at the ladle's edge.		Soil is scooped up into a ladel. The extra drop is brushed off to make it level.	To remember the extra stroke in the ladle, make a vivid image of a big drop of excess soil fr0m the ladle falling out onto the ground when you level it.	5	2	キン	なら.す	
173	fire	HOẢ	火	fire	4	8	Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.	* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a fireplace (or hearth) or a raging conflagration like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for fire, based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean flames, cauldron, cooking fire, or an oven fire.	For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on fire!	A tepee getting shot at by fire arrows.	1	5	カ	ひ、-び、ほ-	火 (ひ)
174	inflammation	VIÊM (Bốc cháy, ngọn lửa, viêm nhiệt)	炎	inflammation, fire, fire2	8	8	A fire belongs IN the hearth, not OVER it. When the fire spreads to the rest of the house, we have an inflamed house. And as with any inflammation - including those that attack our bodies - the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of element for fire, one atop the other.		To fight fire with fire would just inflame a situation.	An inflammation can often feel like FIRE upon FIRE burning.	JH	1	エン	ほのお	炎 (ほのお)
175	anxiety	PHIỀN (Phiền muộn)	煩	anxiety, fire, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	13	8	The existential condition of anxiety that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character. The head is set afire, causing deep torment of spirit (and a whopper of a headache).		An anxiety feels like FIRE in the HEAD.	"Many performers get ""Michael Jackson anxiety"" wherein they fear their head will catch on fire."	JH	1	ハン、ボン	わずら.う、わずら.わす	煩雑 (はんざつ), 煩う (わずら.う), 煩わす (わずら.わす)
176	thin	ĐẠM (Đạm bạc)	淡	thin, water, water droplets, water pistol, inflammation, fire, fire2	11	8	The primitives in this kanji read: water . . . inflammation. Taking inflammation in its medical sense, the first water-related inflammation that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very thin. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very thin chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being inflamed with) dehydration (hence the element for water).		Drink water and burn twice as many calories as you eat... you´ll definitely get thin. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being burned from above and below... THAT´s what it takes to become thin.	Thin girls are twice as hot when they´re wet.	JH	1	タン	あわ.い	淡い (あわ.い)
177	lamp	Đăng (Ngọn hải đăng)	灯	lamp, fire, street, nail, spike	6	8	Since it is very hard to read by the fireplace without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to nail down a bit of that fire, just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The lamp.		Imagine old gas lamps which had a flame to light up the street signs.	A lamp is fire you can hang from a nail.	4	2	トウ	ひ、ほ-、ともしび、とも.す、あかり	灯 (ひ)
178	farm	VƯỜN	畑	farm, fire, rice field, brains	9	8	Looking at the primitives, a fireplace and a rice field, we find the essential ingredients for a farm: a warm hearth to sit by at night, and a well-plowed field to grow one's crops in by day.		Many farms are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.	When creating a farm, the prospective farmer must first set fire to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the fields. Fire before fields to make a farm.	3			はた、はたけ、-ばたけ	畑 (はた), 畑 (はたけ)
179	disaster	TAI (Tai hoạ)	災	disaster, stream, flood, fire	7	8	Of all of nature's disasters, this kanji picks out two of the worst: floods and fires. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great flood pouring down over a great forest fire.		What a disaster! First a FIRE, then on top of it came FLOODs.	Don´t know about Japan, but here in Australia, flooding rivers and bushfires are the most common natural disasters.	5	1	サイ	わざわ.い	災い (わざわ.い)
180	ashes	HÔI	灰	ashes, cliff, fire	6	8	The kanji for ashes naturally includes the primitive for fire, or more specifically, a fireplace. Now what do you do with that bucket of ashes you have just cleaned out of the fireplace? You walk to the edge of a cliff and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the fire, once it has turned to ashes, ends up at the bottom of the cliff.		The fire underneath the cliff will eventually turn everything above to ashes.	"Scene from ""The Big Lebowski"" : Walter scatters Donny´s ashes, but a wind blows much of the ashes into ""The Dude"" Lebowski´s face. Upset, The Dude lashes out at Walter. Walter apologizes and hugs The Dude, before suggesting ""Fuck it, man. Let´s go bowling."" I bet you that The Dude wanted to cremate (fire) Walter right there and then, at the top of the cliff! (thanks Elktapestry)."	6	2	カイ	はい	灰 (はい)
181	spot	ĐIỂM	点	spot, fortune-telling, magic wand, augury, mouth, oven-fire, barbecue	9	8	If you look into the flickering of a fire for a long time and then turn aside, you will see spots before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those spots as a technique for fortune-telling. The old witch sits before her cauldron and watches the spots that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that tells your fortune. Think of it as a kind of spot-check on your future.		The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the spot because she was accused of being a witch.	You have to stimulate the G-spot with your magic wand in order to get her on fire. Or you can juste use your mouth...	2	3	テン	つ.ける、つ.く、た.てる、さ.す、とぼ.す、とも.す、ぼち	
182	illuminate	CHIẾU (Soi sáng)	照	illuminate, shining, sun, day, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth, oven-fire, barbecue	13	8	Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for illuminate can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something shine. If you glaze a pot and put it into the oven to fire it, you in fact illuminate it. Hence the kanji for illuminate compares the kanji for shining with the primitive element for the oven's fire.		SHINING FLAMES illuminate!	The sun was seduced to give us fire, by which we illuminate the night.	4	2	ショウ	て.る、て.らす、て.れる	照らす (て.らす), 照る (て.る), 照れる (て.れる)
183	fish	NGƯ (Kình ngư)	魚	fish, bound up, rice field, brains, oven-fire, barbecue	11	8	The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: bound up . . . rice field . . . cooking fire. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the rice fields for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cooking fire for his supper.		The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind fish.	Bind that FISH and cook his brains! Yarhh!	2	4	ギョ	うお、さかな、-ざかな	魚 (うお), 魚 (さかな)
184	fishing	NGƯ (Ngư nghiệp)	漁	fishing, water, water droplets, water pistol, fish, bound up, rice field, brains, oven-fire, barbecue	14	8	To the story we have just made about fish, this kanji for the profession of fishing adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the water, where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the water when you put it all together.		You need WATER and FISH for fishing.	If you are confusing this with angling like me, take fishing to mean not the act of catching a fish but the act of being a fish not living but fishing (i.e. in the water).	4	2	ギョ、リョウ	あさ.る	漁業 (ぎょぎょう), 漁船 (ぎょせん), 漁村 (ぎょそん)
185	ri House of the Parents.	DẶM (360 bước là một dặm.)	里	ri, computer, rice field, brains, soil, dirt, ground	7	9	"That's right - a ri. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One ri is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the rice field, and below the element for land. Those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of land, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a ""country mile."" The land division based on the size of a rice field is called a ri."	* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a computer, a meaning deriving from the kanji for logic, which we will meet in Lesson 12.	The ri is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a RICE FIELD.	Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You´ll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: House of the Parents.	2		リ	さと	里 (さと)
186	black	HẮC	黒	black, computer, oven-fire, barbecue	11	9	Like most things electrical, a computer, too, can overheat. Just imagine flames pouring out of it and charring the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty black color.		If you burn the GROUND of a RICE FIELD with FIRE, eventually it will turn black.	If your parent´s home catches on fire, it will turn black.	2	4	コク	くろ、くろ.ずむ、くろ.い	黒 (くろ), 黒い (くろ.い)
187	black ink	MỰC, MẶC	墨	black ink, black, computer, oven-fire, barbecue	14	9	Besides meaning black ink, this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the dirt with black lines for a foot ballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).		Theres BLACK on the GROUND...most likely someone spilt some black ink.	Anyone who has worked with laserjet ink cartridges will know the black ink looks like powdered dirt.	JH	1	ボク	すみ	墨 (すみ)
188	carp	LÍ (Cá chép)	鯉	carp, fish, bound up, rice field, brains, oven-fire, barbecue, computer	18	9	"These are the same carp you see in Japanese ""carp streamers."" Only here we find a small home computer or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a carp swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a computer. Ugh."		Japanese carp are massive fish - they are measured in ri!	The fish got carpal tunnel syndrome from the computer(I know it´s lame but it´s hard to find a good story for this).	Names	1	リ	こい	
189	quantity	LƯỢNG, LƯƠNG	量	quantity, nightbreak, sun, day, one, floor, computer	12	9	Think of quantity as having to do with measuring time and distance, and the rest is simple: you have a quantity of time in the new day that begins with nightbreak, and a quantity of distance in the rural ri.		I did such a quantity of work that when NIGHT BREAK came, I was asleep on the COMPUTER.	If you find that by nightbreak, you´re still playing at your computer, chances are your World of Warcraft character has a high quantity of levels. [thanks to ssmoler] ..... To remember that nightbreak appears ABOVE computer, think of looking UP from your computer at the window to realize you´ve been playing until nightbreak.	4	2	リョウ	はか.る	量る (はか.る)
190	rin	LI (sai một li đi một dặm)	厘	rin, cliff, computer	9	9	"No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One rin is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something ""very, very tiny."" The kanji shows a cliff with a computer under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home computer that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one rin!"		I threw my Rindows computer off a cliff because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it´s worth less than a rin.	A computer dropped off of a cliff would be worth about 1 RIN.	JH	1	リン		
191	bury	MAI (Mai táng)	埋	bury, soil, dirt, ground, computer	10	9	"When we speak of burying something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under ground. Only here, we are burying our beloved computer that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the ""Dies irae, dies illa"" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little dirt into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P."		You can´t bury computers underground, because of the dangerous heavy metals, so you hide them behind an equally large mound of soil and hope no-one notices.	I used SOIL to BURY my COMPUTER.	JH	2	マイ	う.める、う.まる、う.もれる、うず.める、うず.まる、い.ける	埋まる (う.まる), 埋める (う.める), 埋もれる (う.もれる)
192	same	ĐỒNG	同	same, monks, hood, one, mouth	6	9	"The primitives in this kanji show us one and mouth under a hood. Let us take the key word to connote the sameness that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the same habits, including the ""habit"" they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's cowl, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a mouth. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of one mouth under a hood as the kanji for the sameness of monastic life."	* As a primitive, this will mean monks dressed in a common habit.	Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the same, you can just see ONE MOUTH and very little else.	Imagine monks wandering around the monastery. Covered in their hoods and chanting as if with one mouth they all look the same !	2	4	ドウ	おな.じ	同じ (おな.じ)
193	den	ĐỘNG (hang sâu)	洞	den, water, water droplets, water pistol, same, monks, hood, one, mouth	9	9	"The key word den refers to an animal lair hollowed out in the side of a mountain. Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for same, we can picture a den of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of water we need only give them a sacred ""puddle"" in the center of their den, the focus of all their pious attentions."		All the animals in the den share the same water.	"Den and ""cave"" also make me think of a monk´s cell. Monks take vows of silence and fast. So a den is where you´d find nothing but water (to drink) and a monk."	JH	1	ドウ	ほら	洞 (ほら)
194	trunk	ĐỖNG (Cái thân người, từ cổ xuống đến bẹn, trừ chân tay ra)	胴	trunk, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, same, monks, hood, one, mouth	10	9	"The word trunk refers to the part of the body that is left when you have ""truncated"" all the limbs. I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the same so they could be floated downstream without causing a body-jam."		A trunk, a trunk // The body of a monk // The body of a monk in a trunk, a trunk.	Dead flesh all looks the same when you chop off everything but the trunk. Yes, I´m appalled at how gruesome this story is too.	JH	1	ドウ		
195	yonder	HƯỚNG (xu hướng)	向	yonder, alien, drop, helmet, hood, mouth	6	9	"Something referred to as ""over yonder"" is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight - like a wee drop in the distance - and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out. Hence this kanji begins with a drop. Then we find a sort of transparent helmet with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent mouth under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its mouth open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over yonder with its fuel tank on empty."		Look over yonder ! That tiny dot is robin hood at the mouth of his secret cave !	There was an old woman named Wanda,// Who wanted to make herself blonder.// She covered her くち// With a glass hood from Gucci// And dropped some hair dye on from yonder.	3	3	コウ	む.く、む.い、-む.き、む.ける、-む.け、む.かう、む.かい、む.こう、む.こう-、むこ、むか.い	向かう (む.かう), 向く (む.く), 向ける (む.ける), 向こう (む.こう)
196	esteem	THƯỢNG (Cao thượng, thượng thư)	尚	esteem, small, little, alien, glass canopy, hood, mouth	8	9	Above we see the primitive for little attached to one of those glass canopies you might use to display a family heirloom. The littleness is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted mouth of an esteemed ancestor. We may be used to esteeming the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also esteem the very mouth that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.		An especially esteemed alien has three antennae on his helmet.	Remember that scene from Star Wars, where Luke is wearing that helmet that only his mouth could see, and was swinging at that little thing buzzing around the room? That was Obi-Wan´s trick to get Luke to build his self-esteem, or his confidence in the Force.	JH	1	ショウ	なお	
197	character	TỰ ()	字	character, house, child	6	9	Here is the character for character itself. Not just kanji, but any written character from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a child in a house. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a child born to a Japanese house is given characters for its name, so it is also stamped with the character of those who raise it from infancy on.		"Why do I have to wear this roof on my head all the time father? ""Shut up! It builds character!""."	CHILDren learn Kanji characters underneath a HOUSE.	1	4	ジ	あざ、あざな、-な	字 (あざ)
198	guard	THỦ, THÚ (bảo thủ)	守	guard, house, glue	6	9	The notion of guarding something easily brings to mind the image of someone standing guard, like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope's Swiss Guard. The whole idea of hiring guards is that they should stick like glue to your house to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and glue a guard to your house in imagination.		"A GUARD is usually ""glued"" to the house he watches."	A guard provides a measure of security to those under a roof.	3	3	シュ、ス	まも.る、まも.り、もり、-もり、かみ	守備 (しゅび), 保守 (ほしゅ), 攻守 (こうしゅ), 守る (まも.る), 守 (もり)
199	perfect	HOÀN	完	perfect, house, beginning, two, human legs	7	9	"In order not to confuse the key word perfect with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. Per-factum suggests something so ""thoroughly made or done"" that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a house that has been made perfectly from its beginnings in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for complete."		Make the perfect impression in the beginning by removing your shoes upon entering a Japanese home.	In the beginning, Adam and Eve had a home in Eden. It was perfect.	4	3	カン		
200	proclaim	TUYÊN (Tuyên bố)	宣	proclaim, house, span, one, ceiling, sun, day, one, floor, one	9	9	"Under the primitive for house we meet the kanji for span. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: ""proclaiming the good news to all nations"" and ""shouting it from the housetops."" That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising."		You can proclaim your opinions from the comfort of your HOUSE and have it SPAN the entire globe these days via The Internet.	I heard young Muslims have to memorise the Koran and proclaim it aloud as a kind of rite of passage. Imagine the SPAN of hours spent under a ROOF practising that! It must surely be worse than trying to get through Heisigs RTK - count yourself lucky.	6	1	セン	のたま.う、のたま.わく	
201	wee hours	TIÊU (đêm)	宵	wee hours, house, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	10	9	"As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a house with a candle in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is ""burning the candle at both ends,"" and working night after night into the wee hours."		I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the WEE HOURS reviewing the kanji!!!	"I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means ""early evening"", not ""wee hours"" [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 ""but of course"" -- what the hell???). Oh well.] ""Every house lights candles in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the wee hours"". E.G. 宵の口（よいのくち）early evening; 今宵（こよい）this evening; tonight."	JH	1	ショウ	よい	宵 (よい)
202	relax	AN, YÊN (Bình an)	安	relax, house, woman	6	9	To be told that the place of the woman is in the house may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of relaxing after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary woman of the house slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap.		It´s funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive... well... if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman relaxing. Cheapest place to do that is in one´s own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? 家で休暇を取るは安いですね。.	You can only relax, when you have woman under roof to do all chores.	3	4	アン	やす.い、やす.まる、やす、やす.らか	安い (やす.い)
203	banquet	YẾN (Yến tiệc)	宴	banquet, relax, house, sun, day, tongue wagging, woman	10	9	"To carry on from the last frame, we note the entire day of work that comes between a woman and her house in preparing for a dinner banquet, pictorially ""interrupting"" her relaxation."		The WOMAN spent all DAY preparing a banquet in the HOUSE.	Under the roof, all day long, the woman prepared for the banquet (this wording helps me remember the order of this kanji´s elements).	JH	1	エン	うたげ	
204	draw near	KÍ ()	寄	draw near, house, strange, large, St. Bernard, can, street, nail, spike, mouth	11	9	Let the idea of drawing near suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a strange house - perhaps the haunted House of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread House that lured Hansel and Gretel to draw near.		"The strange house has a sign saying ""DRAW NEAR"" in its window, instead of a ´Beware´ sign. It must be a trick!"	Imagine a horror movie set in a haunted mansion. The house is very strange. The characters draw near to one another for protection against the unknown.	5	3	キ	よ.る、-よ.り、よ.せる	寄せる (よ.せる), 寄る (よ.る)
205	wealth	PHÚ (giàu)	富	wealth, house, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains	12	9	Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for wealth is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the wealth is kept under the roof of the same house.		Remember Ducktales? That rich duck had that room in his house where he kept all the wealth! He had so much in that house you could even swim in it!	In ancient Japan, a RICE FIELD is a unit of wealth as it can produce enough to feed all the MOUTHs in ONE HOUSE.	5	3	フ、フウ	と.む、とみ	富強 (ふきょう), 富裕 (ふゆう), 貧富 (ひんぷ), 富む (と.む), 富 (とみ)
206	savings	TRỮ	貯	savings, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, house, street, nail, spike	12	9	To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of savings as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but shells, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The nail under the roof of the house points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's shells for safekeeping.		It takes a lot more than one clam of savings to buy a house on a street.	My SAVINGS plan - I nail my moneybags up in the rafters below my roof. I´m very secretive about it, and I wear a disguise with a big mustache (another meaning of this kanji) while I stash my loot.	4	2	チョ	た.める、たくわ.える	
207	tree	Mộc	木	tree, wood	4	10	Here we see a pictograph of a tree, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.	* As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean tree or wood. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk, we shall change its meaning to pole, or wooden pole.	If you need a story for a tree, then you need to be hit by one.	Pictograph of a tree.	1	5	ボク、モク	き、こ-	木石 (ぼくせき), 大木 (たいぼく), 土木 (どぼく), 木 (き)
208	grove	Lâm	林	grove, tree, wood, tree2, wood2	8	10	Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A grove is a small cluster of trees. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for tree gives us the grove.		A grove has at least two TREEs.	Two tree huggers saying that protecting the environment is grovey man...　RTK2:　リン　森林　しんりん(woods and forests).	1	2	リン	はやし	林 (はやし)
209	forest	sâm. sâm lâm = rừng rậm	森	forest, tree, wood, tree3, wood3	12	10	"A forest is a large expanse of trees, or ""trees, trees everywhere,"" to adopt the expression we used back in frames 22 and 23."		The higher you go up a mountain the less trees there are, that´s so u dont mess up with their possition like i do.	Another tree planted within a grove turns it into a FOREST.	1	2	シン	もり	森 (もり)
210	Japanese Judas-tree	quế	桂	Japanese Judas tree, tree, wood, ivy, square jewel, soil, dirt, ground, soil2, dirt2, ground2	10	10	Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a Japanese Judas-tree looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a tree with ivy growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope.		"Simple mnemonic : ""The Japanese Judas-tree is the tree on which Judas hang himself to the ivy"" (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible). Just picture Judas hanging himself, using ivy as a if it was a rope."	A tree covered in poison ivy will quickly betray you, thus the name JAPANESE JUDAS-TREE.	Names	1	ケイ	かつら	
211	oak	Bách, Bá. (Cây bách)	柏	oak, tree, wood, white, dove	9	10	"This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the ""golden bough."" As you may recall, what made the sacred oak in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome ""golden"" were the white berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don't know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji - which of course you won't - the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.)"		The wood from oak trees can be used to make barrels in which white wine is aged. What´s more, I love white wine with an oaky flavour...	An oak tree is white, from left to right!	Names		ハク、ヒャク、ビャク	かしわ	
212	frame	KHUNG	枠	frame, tree, wood, ninety, nine, baseball, ten, needle	8	10	You might think of the frame this character refers to as the sort of frame we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin wood; and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the nine and the ten.		wood at 90 (9 * 10) degrees.	Nine out of ten picture frames are made out of wood. The rest are made of metal or plastic.	JH	1		わく	枠 (わく)
213	treetops	SAO,TIÊU (Ngọn cây)	梢	treetops, tree, wood, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	11	10	As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing candles to the branches of evergreen trees, it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the treetops to fix candles on the tree.		At Christmas time, on the treetops, people used to place great big candles (Now we usually place a star instead).	If you cut off the treetops, they still resemble the trees they used to be part of. Treetops=tree resemblance.	Names	1	ショウ	こずえ、くすのき	
214	shelf	BẰNG (Gác, nhà rạp.)	棚	shelf, tree, wood, companion, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, moon2, month2, flesh, 2, part of the body2	12	10	"One often thinks of books as ""good companions,"" but here it is the shelf we store them on that is the companion. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, wood, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story."		A shelf is a wooden companion to books.	I think of an Otaku, with a wooden shelf full of anime action figure statures, who are sadly his only companions.	JH	1	ホウ	たな、-だな	棚 (たな)
215	apricot	Hạnh (Cây hạnh)	杏	apricot, tree, wood, mouth	7	10	Since apricots can be eaten just as they fall from the trees, picture this mouth agape at the bottom of a tree (just as the elements have it), waiting for apricots to fall into it.		From the tree straight into the mouth is the best way to eat an APRICOT!	Imagine Totoro sleeping under his tree. As he snores a giant apricot falls nicely into his open mouth and he emits a giant burp of satisfaction. I can hear that music alreay....to - to to - to - ro...	Names	1	キョウ、アン、コウ	あんず	
216	paulownia	Đồng (cây đồng)	桐	paulownia, tree, wood, same, monks, hood, one, mouth	10	10	"Since you probably don't know what a paulownia tree is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase ""the Little Brothers of St. Paulownia."" It is a short step to associate the tree with the monks to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental tree really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.)"		"In Japan, a paulownia (きり）is known as the ""princess tree"". It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter. It would grow fast enough that, at the time of her wedding, it could be used to make a dresser as a wedding present for her."	Paulownia is a Japanese tree which looks same as any other tree.	Names	1	トウ、ドウ	きり	
217	plant	Thực (Các loài có rễ. Như thực vật)	植	plant, tree, wood, straightaway, ten, needle, eye, fishhook	12	10	You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to plant a young tree and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up straight.		Plants don´t become trees straightaway.	When you plant plants, you use a piece of WOOD to make the plant grow STRAIGHT.	3	2	ショク	う.える、う.わる	植える (う.える), 植わる (う.わる)
219	wither	Khô (Khô héo)	枯	wither, tree, wood, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	9	10	What makes a tree begin to wither up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple old age, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled old tree, withering away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.		A tree withers away as it gets old.	When flowers get old they suffer (frame 225), but old trees just WITHER away painlessly. (Picture flowers crying in pain, but a dried up tree silent and sad).	JH	2	コ	か.れる、か.らす	枯らす (か.らす), 枯れる (か.れる)
220	crude	Phác (chất phác)	朴	crude, tree, wood, magic wand, augury	6	10	As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one's wand out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the wood. For the magic of the wand derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its crude, natural state.		Wooden wands are the crudest. They are nothng compared to their carbon fibre equivilents.	A beginner magician starts with a crude wooden magic wand. Later he´ll upgrade to magicite, of course.	JH	1	ボク	ほう、ほお、えのき	
221	town	Thôn	村	town, tree, wood, measure, glue	7	10	The character for village was associated with rice fields (Frame 96). That for town, a step up on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of trees glued together to measure off the confines of a town.		If you´ve ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you´ll remember that every town was all bordered off by a line of trees with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were glued together so you could only exit town through the main or side gates, (so you couldn´t escape the important scripted scenes.).	Pfft. At it´s core, a town is just a bunch of wood glued together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.	1	2	ソン	むら	村 (むら)
222	inter-	Tương (Tương đương)	相	inter-, tree, wood, eye	9	10	The prefix inter- stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: tree . . . eye. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own eye before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for inter-human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!		The prime minister is having inter-course behind that tree! All you can see are his eyes poking out from the righthand-side of the tree.	"ソウ/ショウ/あ INTER /MUTUAL /ASPECT /PHASE /MINISTER. ""Long ago, before there were telephones, people living far from one another would climb trees to eye each other´s aspects and inter-act for their mutual benefit. Those who did this best became government ministers, with the top person (perhaps the one with the longest neck (首, neck (#70)) becoming the prime minister 「首相 (しゅしょう)""."	3	3	ソウ、ショウ	あい-	相当 (そうとう), 相談 (そうだん), 真相 (しんそう), 相 (あい)
223	desk	Kỷ	机	desk, tree, wood, wind	6	10	We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for desk: the wonderful rough wood of which it has been hewn and the wind that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character.		My wooden desk is so messy, it looks like a strong wind blew my things all over it.	Whenever I´m alone at my computer desk, I´m always getting wood and breaking wind.	6	2	キ	つくえ	机 (つくえ)
224	book	Bổn, bản	本	book, tree, wood, one	5	10	"Recalling that books are made of paper, and paper made of trees, one might think of a book as a slice of a tree. Can you seethe ""cross-cut"" in the trunk of the tree? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few books with which to start your own private library."		The origin of a book is paper made out of TREEs. ONE tree can make many books.	An axe cutting a tree to make books.	1	5	ホン	もと	本 (もと)
225	tag	Trát (Cái thẻ, ngày xưa không có giấy, văn tự gì cũng viết vào ván gỗ nhỏ)	札	tag, tree, wood, fishhook	5	10	The tags you see hanging on trees in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of trees they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the tag to the branch as a large fishhook. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.		Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing tags on them.	"Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for ""Paper Money"" w/ the reading さつ (千円札＝1000 Yen paper bill)... It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 (""trump"" playing cards). For the tag meaning I like to think of wooden tags hung on hooks from trees... but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to ""hook you in"" so to speak."	4	2	サツ	ふだ	札 (ふだ)
226	calendar	LỊCH	暦	calendar, cliff, grove, tree, wood, sun, day, tree2, wood2	14	10	Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for days, an appropriate enough way to begin a calendar. Next we see a grove of trees growing under a cliff. The laws of nature being what they are, the trees would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the days on your wall calendar, you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that grove of trees each month, from January under the cliff to December on top of the cliff. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a calendar nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind.		Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a cliff to form or erode. A tree takes many months to grow. But days pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a CALENDAR.	This is just a picture of a wall calendar with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper. You can see the paper curling up at the lower left where a breeze is trying to turn the page.	JH	1	レキ	こよみ、りゃく	暦 (こよみ)
227	plan	Án	案	plan, relax, house, woman, tree, wood	10	10	"Without much effort, the elements relax . . . tree suggest a hammock strung between two trees in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, planning something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best plan of action to take. Be sure to relate the relaxation to the tree, so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like ""legs"" or ""desk"" or ""table"")."		I plan to RELAX on top of that TREE.	If you bring a woman to your house, generally its not a good plan to stick your wood up her bottom, she may scream in pain あん!	4	1	アン	つくえ	
228	parch	Táo (Khô, ráo, hanh hao.)	燥	parch, fire, furniture, wooden goods, mouth, tree, wood, mouth3	17	10	"Parchment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial parchment from wood pulp. The fire at the left and in the ""strong"" position serves to remind us of the root word, ""parch,"" since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like fire. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a ""wood-good,""), wet it, and hold it over a hearth in your mind's eye. Now watch as it parches the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling parchment."		"Tip: goods + wood/tree : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it´s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest ""furniture"" (a common type of wooden goods). REF: parch (FRAME 215) , maneuver (#671), winding (#1369), seaweed (#2035). Story: It´s been so parched recently that your furniture suddenly catches fire."	The parchment says you need fire to make goods from trees.	JH	2	ソウ	はしゃ.ぐ	
229	not yet	Vị (chưa)	未	not yet, tree, wood, one	5	10	As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a tree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the tree.		I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) does not yet (未) have exremities (末) of vermilion (朱).	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) is not yet (末) vermilion (朱).	4	3	ミ、ビ	いま.だ、ま.だ、ひつじ	
230	extremity	Mạt (ngọn, mộc mạt = ngọn cây)	末	extremity, tree, wood, one	5	10	This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the extremity of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.		The tree has reached the extremity of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.	There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let´s try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his extremity into a small hole in a tree.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the extremity? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I´d prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).	4	3	マツ、バツ	すえ	末代 (まつだい), 本末 (ほんまつ), 粉末 (ふんまつ), 末 (すえ)
232	splash	Mạt (Bọt nổi lên trên mặt nước.)	沫	splash, water, water droplets, water pistol, extremity, one, tree, wood	8	10	The splash this kanji refers to is the dash of water against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a splash in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its extremity, namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind's eye, this somewhat rare (but oh so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good.		The extremity of a wave of water is the splash.	A splash is WATER that has reached its EXTREMITY.	Names		マツ、バツ	あわ、しぶき、つばき	
233	flavor	Vị	味	flavor, mouth, not yet, one, tree, wood	8	10	When a tree has not yet finished growing, it produces fruit with a full flavor. When the official taster (the professional mouth to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently not yet grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of flavor hidden in this character.		My mouth has not yet swallowed the food because the flavor is so delicious that I keep chewing it.	To enjoy a food´s FLAVOR, it must be in one´s MOUTH but NOT YET swallowed.	3	4	ミ	あじ、あじ.わう	味 (あじ), 味わう (あじ.わう)
234	younger sister	Muội	妹	younger sister, woman, not yet, one, tree, wood	8	10	The younger sister in the family is the woman in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is not yet old enough or mature enough to do everything the elder sister can do (See frame 442).		My younger sister is NOT YET a fully grown WOMAN.	Is your younger sister a woman? Not yet! Damn!	2	4	マイ	いもうと	妹 (いもうと)
235	vermilion	Chu (đỏ)	朱	vermillion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood	6	10	That red-orange color we call vermilion is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the drop hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has not yet fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, vermilion is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.)		It´s autumn: only one vermilion leaf on the tree has not yet fallen.	[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) is not yet (未)[correction wrong character before] vermilion (朱).	JH	1	シュ	あけ	
236	stocks	Chu, châu (cổ phiếu)	株	stocks, tree, wood, vermillion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood	10	10	"The stocks bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy tree, in which one takes ""stock"" in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more trees like itself. Usually good stocks are referred to as ""blue chip,"" but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color vermilion, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves."		Which tree would you buy stocks in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one vermilion leaf left on the right?	"Ideally, one buys stocks when a company is young, ""green,"" and rapidly growing -- then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins."	6	1	シュ	かぶ	株 (かぶ)
237	young	Nhược , nhã (Bằng, dùng làm ngữ từ, nói sự chưa quyết định)	若	young, flowers, right, by one’s side, mouth	8	10	Here we see a flower held in the right hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where flowers picked with the right hand grant eternal youth; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens.		The young little girl held a cute flower in her right hand.	In Hawaii, if you wear a flower over your left ear, it means you are taken. A flower over the right means you are not. The younger you are, the more likely you are to have a flower over your right ear…　　　　　　RTK2: 　ニャク　老若　ろうにゃく (young and old)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ジャク　若干　じゃっかん(few).	6	3	ジャク、ニャク、ニャ	わか.い、わか-、も.しくわ、も.し、も.しくは	若年 (じゃくねん), 若干 (じゃっかん), 自若 (じじゃく), 若しくは (も.しくは), 若い (わか.い)
238	grass	Thảo	草	grass, flowers, sunflower, early, sun, day, ten, needle	9	10	Perhaps you know the custom of seeding grass randomly or in some particular pattern with the flower called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in early spring. As the grass begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny flowers dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of grass somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in flowers once as a sort of early harbinger of spring.		Grass grows in earlier than flowers.	This grass is very long. The only flowers you can see are sunflowers – the rest are hidden by the grass.	1	3	ソウ	くさ、くさ-、-ぐさ	草 (くさ)
239	suffering	Khổ	苦	suffering, flowers, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	8	10	The picture of suffering we are given here is that of a flower that has grown old. When a flower ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even suffers. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.		Flowers for the old man suffering in the hospital.	The derivates from opium poppies such as morphine can be used to tame the suffering of the old.	3	3	ク	くる.しい、-ぐる.しい、くる.しむ、くる.しめる、にが.い、にが.る	苦しい (くる.しい), 苦しむ (くる.しむ), 苦しめる (くる.しめる), 苦い (にが.い), 苦る (にが.る)
241	tolerant	KHOAN (khoan dung)	寛	tolerant, house, flowers, look, see, telescope, eye, human legs	13	10	"The house of flowers or ""hothouse"" has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. Tolerance, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage tolerance in those who lack it is first to have them see through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji."		A tolerant person will ignore SEEing GRASS (marijuana) in the HOUSE of a friend.	"To be tolerant is to see flowers (meaning ""beautiful things"") in every house, instead of looking for drawbacks."	JH	1	カン	くつろ.ぐ、ひろ.い、ゆる.やか	
242	dilute	Bạc (bạc mệnh, bạc vị = nhạt)	薄	dilute, flowers, water, water droplets, water pistol, acupuncturist, specialty, drop, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue	16	10	"Take a good look at this kanji: the ""strong"" element here is really the flower, not the water as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the acupuncturist from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote diluting the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our acupuncturist performing his task with flowers in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe water into the body of the patient."		A Dr. missing his needle can only use dilute flower water for medicine.	Note This character belongs to a set of characters which share the flower/water primitive such as:: dilute (#227), fall (#299), clan (#1912), and seaweed (#2035).... (落 薄 藩 藻) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like seaweed or watering can) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like Sino 満 and Full 満, where the water primitive is larger than the flower primitive.	JH	2	ハク	うす.い、うす-、-うす、うす.める、うす.まる、うす.らぐ、うす.ら-、うす.れる、すすき	薄い (うす.い), 薄まる (うす.まる), 薄める (うす.める), 薄らく (うす.らく), 薄れる (うす.れる)
243	leaf	Diệp (lá)	葉	leaf, flowers, Tarzan, generation, tree, wood	12	10	"Three elements are given here: flower . . . generation . . . tree. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the leaf that feeds the flowers on a tree. The element for generation interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a tree from one generation to the next is like its ""turning over a new leaf."""		On top of the leaves a flower appears, promising new generations for the old tree below.	The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.	3	3	ヨウ	は	葉 (は)
244	imitation	Mô (Khuôn mẫu)	模	imitation, tree, wood, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard	14	10	Ah, but haven't modern graveyards become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing imitation trees in the graveyard. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.		If I find out this furniture you´re selling me is made of imitation wood, I´ll put you in the graveyard.	The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put IMITATION plastic trees in their graveyards! (No, not really, but I wouldn´t be surprised).	6	1	モ、ボ		模範 (もはん), 模型 (もけい), 模倣 (もほう)
245	vague	Mạc (mờ mịt)	漠	vague, water, water droplets, water pistol, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard	13	10	Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are vaguely discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true graveyard. The water may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate vagueness with the graveyard and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.		The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are vague.	The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is vague.	JH	1	バク		
246	grave	Mộ	墓	grave, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard, soil, dirt, ground	13	10	"The mounds of soil with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill graves we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the soil comes UNDER the graveyard, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as ""lying under boot-hill"" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji."		The soil under a graveyard is full of graves.	A grave is a patch of soil in a graveyard.	5	1	ボ	はか	墓 (はか)
247	livelihood	MỘ (chiều tối, già, cuối)	暮	livelihood, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard, sun2, day2	14	10	Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a graveyard and spend your days tending to other's dead hood in order to make your means of livelihood.		He made a livelihood out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight.	The gravedigger makes his LIVELIHOOD digging in the graveyard all day For graveyard, imagine an idyllic picture: beautiful grass with the sun shining down...and a dog peeing on one of the graves. Don´t confuse with occupation (#1034). Hold onto the irony of making your LIVElyhood from tending dead people.	6	3	ボ	く.れる、く.らす	暮らす (く.らす), 暮れる (く.れる)
248	membrane	Mô (màng)	膜	membrane, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard	14	10	"The part of the body first affected by a stroll through a haunted graveyard is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word ""skin"" for another kanji, and use the odd word ""membrane"" here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose membranes."		In the moonlight of the graveyard I hear a zombie say, MMMMM..EMM...BRANEsssss.	The membranes in your flesh rot when placed in the graveyard.	JH	1	マク		
249	seedling	Miêu (mầm)	苗	seedling, flowers, rice field, brains	8	10	"To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these seedlings out of their agricultural setting in the rice fields and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where ""ideas"" or ""values"" are being implanted into brains like seedlings to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into flower right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets."		If you plant seedlings in a FIELD eventually they will FLOWER.	Crap! There are flowers in the rice field... Who let those seedlings get in there?!	JH	1	ビョウ、ミョウ	なえ、なわ-	苗 (なえ)
250	portent	TRIỆU (dấu hiệu; điềm báo) /ˈpɔːtent $ ˈpɔːr-/	兆	portent, turtle, portent	6	11	Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that portend coming evils.	* When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a portent. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a turtle.	When your wife´s LEGs get huge hairs on them it is surely a bad portent for things to come.	A bad portent makes the hairs on your legs stand.	4	2	チョウ	きざ.す、きざ.し	兆し (きざ.し), 兆す (きざ.す)
251	peach tree	ĐÀO	桃	peach tree, tree, wood, portent, turtle	10	11	To associate the peach tree with the primitive for a portent, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the Peach Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant peach, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named Peach Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also portended great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the tree that is associated with a portent of coming evil comes to be the peach tree.		The pits of a peach tree look like turtles.	King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he´s going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.	JH	1	トウ	もも	桃 (もも)
252	stare	THIẾU (nhìn; ngắm)	眺	stare, eye, portent, turtle	11	11	"To give someone the ""evil eye"" is to stare at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being stared at is depicted as an eye that portends evil."		Sauron´s One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.	You lost a staring contest with a turtle because you blinked your eye before he did. (The contest wasn´t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don´t need to blink so often.) Eye comes first, because stare is most associated with eyes. And compare with challenge (#658) where this same obstreperous turtle challenges you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl´s story with some notes that helped me).	JH	1	チョウ	なが.める	眺める (なが.める)
253	dog	KHUYỂN	犬	dog, large, St. Bernard, drop	4	11	We know that the character for large takes on the meaning of the St. Bernard dog when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The drop added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized dog, which compared to the St. Bernard is no more than a drop in the kennel.	* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a chihuahua for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of a pack of wild dogs.	A large dog, dripping drool.	If we remember large (#107) as a man with his arms outstretched, the drop represents man´s best friend - a dog.	1	4	ケン	いぬ、いぬ-	犬 (いぬ)
254	status quo	TRẠNG (the state of a situation as it is)	状	status quo, turtle, chihuahua, dog, large, drop	7	11	Did you ever hear of the turtle who fell madly in love with a chihuahua but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the status quo with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.		It was left to the turtle to make right with the dog and thus maintain the status quo..	A turtle mounting a chihuahua clearly disrupts the status quo.	5	3	ジョウ		
255	silence	MẶC (MẶC SÁT sự không để ý tới; sự lờ đi; sự mặc kệ)	黙	silence, black, computer, chihuahua, dog, large, drop, oven-fire, barbecue	15	11	"Oddly enough, the character for silence shows us a black chihuahua. Actually, the cute little critter's name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about silence that begins, ""Hello, Darkness, my old friend...."" Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character."		The computer won´t stop beeping, which is making the chihauhua bark, and it´s driving this guy insane. The only solution he can come up with is to throw them both on the fire and finally enjoy the silence.	Your neighbor is so sick of you playing Led Zeppelin that he takes your copy of the song Black Dog and burns it. Finally, silence in the neighborhood.	JH	1	モク、ボク	だま.る、もだ.す	黙る (だま.る)
256	sort of thing	NHIÊN (quả nhiên, tất nhiên)	然	sort of thing, moon, crescent moon, month, flesh, part of the body, chihuahua, dog, large, drop, oven-fire, barbecue	12	11	"The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as ""sort of thing."" Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an oven flame with the flesh of a chihuahua being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a ""hot-diggity, dog-diggity"" sort of thing."		"Flesh of a dog over a cooking fire = ""hotdog"". There are all sorts of things in hot dogs. Believe me, you don´t want to know what sort of things . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr´s. Thanks!)."	There are all sorts of things in hot dogs. (I use hot dog for this primitive (meat of a dog over a cooking fire). I swear I can actually see the 月 here as a hot dog, with its slight curve and grill marks.).	4	3	ゼン、ネン	しか、しか.り、しか.し、さ	当然 (とうぜん), 自然 (しぜん), 必然 (ひつぜん)
257	reed	ĐỊCH ([countable, uncountable] a type of tall plant like grass that grows in wet places)	荻	reed, flowers, pack of wild dogs, fire	10	11	"You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp reeds with a furry flower to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome pack of wild dogs: lure them into a swamp of these reeds with the cattail flowers and then set fire to the swamp. Take care to focus on the flower rather than the ""cattail"" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below."		REEDS are the only FLOWERS that WILD DOGS like to FIRE up and smoke while they are playing poker.	A reed is a flower that looks like a hot dog.	Names		テキ	おぎ	
258	hunt	THÚ (săn bắn)	狩	hunt, pack of wild dogs, guard, house, glue	9	11	One of the worst problems you have to face when you go hunting is to guard your take from the wild dogs. If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding.		Actually when hunting it may be a good idea to use a pack of dogs as your personal guard.	After a pack of wild dogs hunt some food, they will guard it fiercely.	JH	1	シュ	か.る、か.り、-が.り	狩り (か.り), 狩る (か.る)
259	cat	MIÊU	猫	cat, pack of wild dogs, seedlings, flowers, rice field, brains	11	11	"Knowing how much dogs love to chase cats, picture a pack of wild dogs planting ""cat-seedlings,"" watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of cats for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a ""crop of cats,"" you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago."		The cat hid in the FLOWERS of the FIELD from the WILD DOGs.	Dawgs always wanna put their seedlings in pussies.	JH	3	ビョウ	ねこ	猫 (ねこ)
260	cow	NGƯU (a large female animal that is kept on farms and used to produce milk or meat)	牛	cow	4	11	"Can you the ""doodle"" of a cow that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs."	* As a primitive, the same sense of cow is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.	A cow tried to climb up a vermilion tree, but in doing so, it broke its two bottom branches off.	A cow bleeds vermilion when you cut off two of it´s legs.	2	4	ギュウ	うし	牛 (うし)
261	special	ĐẶC (ĐẶC BIỆT)	特	special, cow, Buddhist temple, soil, dirt, ground, glue	10	11	Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word special distinct from the character we met earlier for specialty (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a special class all its own - like the sacred cows of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the cows should be placed on the sacred grounds of a Buddhist temple in this kanji.		Think of not special people, but special animals. The sacred Hindu cows are special - they can wander around the temple without fear of becoming roast beef.	"The Church Lady is traveling through Japan and notices with distaste a sacred cow relieving itself inside a Buddhist Temple. ""Well, isn´t that special""."	4	4	トク		
262	revelation	CÁO (báo cáo, thông cáo)	告	revelation, cow, mouth	7	11	Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts revelation through the mouth of a cow, suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence.		"The revelation makes the cow´s mouth drop down, ""Hamburgers are made of what?!""."	When you get a revelation, you may drop to the ground with your mouth wide open.	4	3	コク	つ.げる	告げる (つ.げる)
263	before	TIÊN	先	before, cow, human legs	6	11	"Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a cow with human legs, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a cow-suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing before, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the ""butt"" of everyone's laughter."		I´ve never seen a cow with human legs before!	"Nasty story but it keeps the meaning true to the kanji. ""BEFORE you stick it in a COW and SPREAD the legs (the bottom stroke of this cow looks like two legs) make sure she has HUMAN LEGS""-------------sorry, I´ll remove if I get enough reports, but will keep if I get more stars."	1	5	セン	さき、ま.ず	先 (さき)
264	wash	TẨY	洗	wash, water, water droplets, water pistol, before, cow, human legs	9	11	"This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: water . . . before. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called ""Pigpen,"" who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him ""Wash-Out."" Everywhere he walks, a spray of water goes before him to sanitize everything he touches."		In Japan, you always wash with water from the shower before you enter the bathtub.	You wash things with WATER to get them back to the clean state they were in BEFORE.	6	3	セン	あら.う	洗う (あら.う)
265	jammed in	GIỚI (Cõi, ở vào khoảng giữa hai cái)	介	jammed in, umbrella, stick, walking cane	4	12	The idea of something getting jammed into something else is depicted here by having a walking stick get jammed into an umbrella frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the umbrella stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight walking stick. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.		"The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for ""jammed in.""."	Two people jammed in under an umbrella. A woman with a dress and a man (straight). It´s always me that ends up getting wet.... but the tail of the skirt is this time!	JH	2	カイ		
266	world	GIỚI	界	world, rice field, brains, jammed in, umbrella, stick, cane	9	12	As the world gets jammed with more and more people, there is less and less space. Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a world so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the rice fields). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being jammed into that already narrow space.		One Japanese farmer I know is so small minded that he thinks the entire world is JAMMED IN the borders of his little RICE FIELD.	A famous philosopher once said that his world consisted of all the things he could jam into his brain.	3	4	カイ		
267	tea	TRÀ	茶	tea, flowers, umbrella, wooden pole	9	12	As everyone knows, tea is made from tea leaves. But the tea plant itself has its own flowers, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the tea, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of flowering tea bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g wooden poles (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny umbrella at the top to shade the delicate-tasting tea flowers.		Some people think drinking tea is boring and quaint. That´s why I spice mine up by adding a cocktail umbrella, which of course is made from a wood-en toothpick supporting a paper umbrella with flowers printed on top.	"When I drink herbal tea I like to drink it under a parasol. If it´s too hot I go ""ho, ho, ho !!"" (katakana ホ)."	2	4	チャ、サ		茶色 (ちゃいろ), 茶番劇 (ちゃばんげき), 番茶 (ばんちゃ)
269	fit	HỢP	合	fit, meeting, umbrella, one, mouth	6	12	The kanji for fit reads literally, top to bottom, as a meeting of mouths - which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't fit with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose mouths didn't fit.		I wouldn´t mind a meeting of mouths with her, she´s really fit !	He had such a big mouth that he could easily fit one whole umbrella in it.	2	3	ゴウ、ガッ、カッ	あ.う、-あ.う、あ.い、あい-、-あ.い、-あい、あ.わす、あ.わせる、-あ.わせる	合同 (ごうどう), 合計 (ごうけい), 結合 (けつごう), 合併 (がっぺい), 合宿 (がっしゅく), 合点 (がてん), 合う (あ.う), 合わす (あ.わす), 合わせる (あ.わせる)
270	pagoda	THÁP (vật kiến trúc cao và có đỉnh nhọn, xây cất trong chùa để tàng trữ xá lợi, kinh sách)	塔	pagoda, soil, dirt, ground, flowers, fit, meeting, umbrella, one, mouth	12	12	On the left we see a mound of dirt, and to the right flowers made to fit together. The two sides combine to create a great pagoda made of dirt, with flowers by the tens of thousands fitted together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and fit a few of the flowers in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.		In order to build a pagoda in this small Japanese garden everything has to fit: the soil to the left and the flowers in the upper right corner.	Pictograph-o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of soil on the left, and a little concrete pagoda in the front with flowers behind it. (To my eye, the fit looks a lot like a little pagoda anyway. This may or may not cause confusion for you, though...).	JH	2	トウ		
271	king	VƯƠNG	王	king, jewel, ball	4	12	See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a king's scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with the basic element for I beam and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in.	* As a primitive, this can mean either king or scepter, but it will usually be taken to mean ball, as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame.	To be king you have to be a real crafty one !	The king unites heaven and earth. (imagine heaven being the top line over the soil).	1	3	オウ、ノウ		
272	jewel	NGỌC	玉	jewel, king, jewel, ball, earring, drop	5	12	Note the drop here in the king's scepter, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious jewel handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.	* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either jewel or ball. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame.	The king is said to have only one family jewel below the belt...	"The king is said to have only one family jewel below the belt...and he hangs left! (I always screw up the direction of the ""drop"")."	1	2	ギョク	たま、たま-、-だま	玉 (たま)
273	treasure	BẢO	宝	treasure, house, king, jewel, ball, earring, drop	8	12	Every house has its treasure, as every thief knows only too well. While the things we treasure most are usually of sentimental value, we take the original sense of the term treasure here and make it refer to jewels kept in one's house.		On treasure island is a single house - where all the jewels are stored.	"Put a ""roof"" (lid) on your jewels and voila! You´ve got a treasure chest."	6	2	ホウ	たから	宝 (たから)
274	pearl	CHÂU	珠	pearl, king, jewel, ball, vermillion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood	10	12	Take care to keep the meaning of this kanji distinct from that for jewel. Think of the most enormous pearl you have ever seen, a great vermilion-colored ball sitting on your ring and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing.		Usually pearls are white, or black. Only a very rare, very expensive pearl is vermillion colored. Such a pearl would be fit for a king.	King Vermillion is a little queer and likes to wear pearl necklaces.	JH	1	シュ	たま	
275	present	HIỆN	現	present, king, jewel, ball, see, telescope, eye, human legs	11	12	"Do not think of a ""gift"" here, but of the present moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a ball in which we see the present - obviously a crystal ball that enables us to see things going on at the present in faraway places."		The KING ... can SEE clearly the PRESENT state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?).	Hey, I want my money back! This crystal ball is out of order, I can see the present instead of the future!	5	3	ゲン	あらわ.れる、あらわ.す、うつつ、うつ.つ	現す (あらわ.す), 現れる (あらわ.れる)
277	lunatic	CUỒNG	狂	lunatic, pack of wild dogs, king, jewel, ball	7	12	"A lunatic is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the ""looneys"" are the legendary lycanthropes or ""wolfmen."" Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going looney and setting himself up as king of a pack of wild dogs that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities."		Oh no ! A pack of dogs has bitten the king. He has turned into a rabid lunatic !	Think of King Nebuchadnezzar, who for 7 years lost his sanity and had to live like a wild animal.	JH	1	キョウ	くる.う、くる.おしい、くるお.しい	狂う (くる.う), 狂おしい (くる.おしい)
279	emperor	HOÀNG	皇	emperor, white, dove, king, jewel, ball	9	12	An emperor, as we all know, is a ruler - something like a king but higher in status. The white bird perched above the king, elevating him to imperial heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that white birds have long done in folklore throughout the world.		Ancient Rome had Emperors instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an emperor is a king in white. (make sure you picture a roman emperor not a japanese one and you´ll be ok).	The white dove descended on the king and he was promoted to emperor.	6	1	コウ、オウ		皇帝 (こうてい), 皇室 (こうしつ), 皇后 (こうごう)
280	display	TRÌNH	呈	display, mouth, king, jewel, ball	7	12	"The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: ""Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the king?"" If we think of display in terms of that famous line, and the king with his head thrown back and his mouth wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position."		The mouth of the king is displaying his bling.	What a pathetic display! The king is sprawled on his throne, head back and mouth wide open, fast asleep. We should never have let him drink so much at that banquet last night.	JH	1	テイ		
281	whole	TOÀN	全	whole, umbrella, king, jewel, ball	6	12	"Wholeness suggests physical and spiritual health, ""having your act together."" The kanji-image for wholeness depicts being ""king under your own umbrella,"" that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word whole?"		"The fat king hogs the whole space under his umbrella. (tweaked version of radical tyro´s story. ""fat"" makes a more vivid image for me.)."	The king takes up the whole space under his umbrella.	3	3	ゼン	まった.く、すべ.て	全く (まった.く)
282	plug	XUYÊN,THEN	栓	plug, tree, wood, whole, umbrella, king, jewel, ball	10	12	Here we think of plug in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: tree . . . umbrella . . . ball. Imagine a tree with a faucet in the side out of which tennis balls are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach umbrella into the tree to plug it up.		"The fat king under his umbrella offers useless advice to the workers. ""You´ll need the whole tree to plug that gap"". Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they´re doing. (I always have trouble bringing up the ""whole"" primitive. This story reminds me how to build that part. )."	To plug the hole, you need to use a whole piece of wood - like a cork or something.	JH	1	セン		
283	logic	LÝ	理	logic, king, jewel, ball, computer	11	12	We first referred to this character back in frame 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of logic we are given is something like a central jewel in a computer, like the jewels in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining jewel, a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all-knowing logic.		The king of LOGIC is the computer.	Computers are ruled by logic (it is the king of computers).	2	4	リ	ことわり	
284	lord	CHỦ,TRÚ	主	lord, drop, king, jewel, ball	5	12	"A man's home is his castle, goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was lord of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or drop) of a king in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to ""read off"" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the drop down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel."	* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass candlestick (with the drop representing the flame at the top).	A lord is a little drop down from King in hierarchy.	Although this kanji´s meaning hasn´t caused me much trouble, I´ve had problems remembering the direction of the drop above king, since drops at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the drop in jewel (#256). Both of them use the king primitive and include a short drop stroke going from the top left to bottom right.	3	4	シュ、ス、シュウ	ぬし、おも、あるじ	主人 (しゅじん), 主権 (しゅけん), 施主 (せしゅ), 主 (おも), 主 (ぬし)
285	pour	CHÚ (Rót, nước chảy rót vào một chỗ)	注	pour, water, water droplets, water pistol, candlestick, lord, drop, king, jewel, ball	8	12	Picture pouring water from a lighted candlestick. What could be more ridiculous, or simpler, as a way to recall this kanji?		Visualize an idiot trying to figure out how to extinguish a candle. He sees a glass of WATER and decides to pour it onto the CANDLESTICK to put it out. Water spills everywhere.	Like water the hot wax poured down the side of the candlestick.	3	4	チュウ	そそ.ぐ、さ.す、つ.ぐ	注ぐ (そそ.ぐ)
286	pillar	TRỤ	柱	pillar, tree, wood, candlestick, lord, drop, king, jewel, ball	9	12	The pillar referred to here is the wooden beam that stands at the entrance to a traditional Japanese house. Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic candlestick and your work is done.		The main pillar in a house should be made of the biggest and strongest tree - the lord of the trees.	"Why has this pillar been carved in the shape of a giant penis?! ""You said that ´it should be made of wood´, My Lord.""."	3	2	チュウ	はしら	柱 (はしら)
287	gold	KIM (Vàng là một loài quý nhất trong loài kim, nên gọi vàng là kim)	金	gold, metal, gold, umbrella, drop, king, jewel, ball, drop2	8	12	If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of gold bullion with an umbrella overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, drop by drop, and shaping them into bars.	* As a primitive, it means not only gold but any metal at all.	The fat king taking up the whole space under the umbrella actually isn´t fat - he just has two big gold bars hidden under his clothes.	"Under the umbrella´s shade, the king sang, "" Drop it to the left, drop it to the right, give me all the GOLD in sight!""."	1	5	キン、コン、ゴン	かね、かな-、-がね	金属 (きんぞく), 金銭 (きんせん), 純金 (じゅんきん), 金 (かね)
288	pig iron	TIỂN (gang, a form of iron that is not pure)	銑	pig-iron, metal, gold, before, cow, human legs	14	12	"Pig iron refers to iron in the crude form in which it emerges from the smelting furnaces. Of all the various forms metal can take, this one shows us metal before it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled ""before"" and ""after"" to show the process."		Pig iron is basic/crude metal, that is, before it has been processed.	Pig-iron is crude metal (金) before (先) it is refined. If you have trouble with this character, envision a big minotaur (cow head with human legs) as a blacksmith, smelting metals and making swords for war.	Names	1	セン		
289	bowl	BÁT	鉢	bowl, metal, gold, origin, book, tree, wood, one	13	12	Let bowl suggest a large and heavy golden bowl into which you are throwing all the books you own to mash them into pulp, for some outrageous reason you will have to think up yourself.		This is the BOWL of an alchemist: see how he mixes metals in his bowl, as he follows the instructions from his book?	If I was begging with a BOWL, I would want GOLD and BOOKS.	JH	1	ハチ、ハツ		鉢 (はち), 植木鉢 (うえきばち)
290	copper	ĐỒNG	銅	copper, metal, gold, same, monks, hood, one, mouth	14	12	"Picture an order of monks serving as chaplains for the police force. Their special habit, made of protective metal, is distinguished by a row of copper buttons just like the ""cops"" they serve."		I can´t believe no one has used this one yet: Copper is metal which looks almost the same as gold. Really, look it up on Wikipedia, it´s yellow and it´s shiny (atleast in some compounds)!	Copper is an excellent conductor. In other words, it´s a metal for which the voltage is the same everywhere. That´s why it´s used for wires.	5	2	ドウ	あかがね	
291	angling (the sport of catching fish with a fishing rod SYN fishing)	ĐIẾU (Câu cá)	釣	angling, metal, gold, ladle, bound up, drop	11	12	The character we learned for fishing (Frame 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the angling of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your angling rod is a golden ladle which you are using to scoop goldfish out of a river.		All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers. Me? I´m a pro. I bring a big-ass golden ladle. I´m a true ANGLING professional.	Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago angling with a golden ladle instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman? Because ´angling´ is just the roman-derived way to say ´fishing´ - use this to distinguish fishing from angling.).	JH	1	チョウ	つ.る、つ.り、つ.り-	釣る (つ.る)
292	needle	CHÂM	針	needle, metal, gold, ten, needle	10	12	In frame 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for needle (on the right) derives. Since we already expect that needles are made of metal, let us picture a set of solid gold darning needles to complete the kanji.		Remember the story of the needle in the haystack. Why would someone even look for a needle if it wasn´t a GOLD NEEDLE?	A golden needle is worth ten times more than an ordinary needle.	6	2	シン	はり	針 (はり)
293	inscription (Khắc chữ vào đồ, hoặc để tự răn mình, hoặc ghi chép công đức gọi là minh)	MINH (a piece of writing inscribed on a stone, in the front of a book etc)	銘	inscription, metal, gold, name, evening, mouth	14	12	Take inscription in the sense of the name you ask the jeweler to carve on a gold bracelet or inside a gold ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time.		A piece of metal with a name on it. Well, this is basically the definition of inscription.	I imagine ancient Egyptian inscriptions: Pharaohs´ names written in gold.	JH	1	メイ		
294	tranquillize	TRẤN (to make a person or animal calm or unconscious by using a drug)	鎮	tranquilize, metal, gold, true, truth, ten, needle, eye, tool, animal legs, eight	18	12	The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of metal to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the truth was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that tranquillize them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed.		Tranquilize - using a metal syringe to get the truth.	Enough gold can tranquilize the truth in anyone.	JH	1	チン	しず.める、しず.まる、おさえ	鎮まる (しず.まる), 鎮める (しず.める)
295	road-way	Đạo (Đường cái thẳng)	道	road-way, neck, horns, drop, eye, road	12	13	"The key word carries both the sense of a road for transit and a way or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the neck of a road. Think of a crowded road-way where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a ""bottleneck."""		When we go out on the ROAD-WAY, we often risk our own necks (that´s why I take the train! ).	Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel´s neck over a dusty road. Her ear pressed to the ground, she can hear the rumble of a carriage thundering down the roadway. Will the hero save her in time? Or will her neck be ground into the road, spilling it´s precious contents into the dust?	2	4	ドウ、トウ	みち	道路 (どうろ), 道徳 (どうとく), 報道 (ほうどう), 道 (みち)
296	guidance	Đạo (Chỉ dẫn. Như khai đạo = mở lối, huấn đạo = dạy bảo, v.v.)	導	guidance, neck, horns, drop, eye, road, glue	15	13	"When we accept someone's guidance, we permit ourselves to be glued to a certain road or way of doing something, and try to ""stick"" to it."		For guidance on the road-way, glue a GPS unit to your car.	Good guidance will help you stay glued to the right path.	5	2	ドウ	みちび.く	導く (みちび.く)
297	crossing	TỬ (ngã tư)	辻	crossing, cross, ten, needle, road	5	13	"Take the first two strokes in the sense we gave them back in frame 10, as the pictograph of a cross, and set it on a road to create a ""crossing."""		Cross-road.	This kanji appears in the remarkable compound, 辻斬り 【つじぎり】 (n): killing a passerby in order to test a new sword. Imagine a cross by the road, at a busy crossing, marking the spot of the unfortunate passerby´s death.	Names			つじ	
298	swift	Tấn (Nhanh chóng. Đi lại vùn vụt, người không lường được gọi là tấn.)	迅	swift, fishhook, cross, ten, needle, road	6	13	"Here we see a crossing in the form of a barbed fishhook, suggesting a swifter alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the ""cloverleaf"" design used on superhighways in the United States."		The car went too swiftly through the crossing and was hooked by the cops.	In the Heisig version of Frogger, you can image ten giant fish hooks sweeping across the road, with our hapless hero ´froggy´ forced to make a swift crossing or end up as fish bait.	JH	1	ジン		
299	create	Tạo	造	create, revelation, cow, mouth, road	10	13	Think of creating as making something out of nothing. Then recall how the way of revelation laid out in the Bible begins with the story of how God created the world out of a dark and chaotic nothingness.		A cow creates a road by eating all the grass on its path.	CREATION is the ROAD to REVELATION (if you´re feeling artsy) :).	5	2	ゾウ	つく.る、つく.り、-づく.り	造る (つく.る)
300	urge	Bách (Thúc giục.)	迫	urge, white, dove, road	8	13	To urge someone to do something, you make the way as appealing as possible, perhaps even whitewashing it a bit.		When you have the URGE to go to White Castle, you know it´s time to hit the road.	When you start down the road of cocaine, you´re sure to feel some pretty bad URGEs soon.	JH	1	ハク	せま.る	迫る (せま.る)
301	escape	Đào (tẩu)	逃	escape, turtle, portent, road	9	13	When escaping from something or someone, one always feels as if one is not going fast enough, like a turtle on an expressway. (Since the turtle is on the road and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in frame 250.)		I used my pants to make a rope, which I then used to escape from prison; hence the naked, hairy legs running along the road!	A turtle version of frogger dodging cars to escape to the other side of the road...　　　RTK2:　トウ　逃走　とうそう(escape)...　　　　　　　MIXED GROUP:　桃236　(ﾁｮｳ): 兆235　眺237　挑658　跳1284.	JH	3	トウ	に.げる、に.がす、のが.す、のが.れる	逃がす (に.がす), 逃げる (に.げる), 逃す (のが.す), 逃れる (のが.れる)
302	environs	BIÊN	辺	environs, dagger, sword, road	5	13	To keep the environs clean and safe, you could cement daggers in the road, blades pointed upwards, so that no polluting traffic could pass by. You could, if you were an ecologically-minded terrorist.		"Caution: this kanji doesn´t mean environment; it means ""environs; boundary; border; vicinity"". To separate the environs, create the border by placing daggers on the road."	To protect the environs around their village, samurai would travel the roads with their swords.	4	2	ヘン	あた.り、ほと.り、-べ	辺境 (へんきょう), 周辺 (しゅうへん), その辺 (そのへん), 辺り (あた.り), 辺 (べ)
303	patrol	(đi) tuần	巡	patrol, deluge, stream, flood, road	6	13	A virtual flood of motorcycle police washing down a road is this kanji's image for a patrol.		The cops don´t PATROL anymore - they just flood the road.	The Venice cops patrol on river roads.	JH	1	ジュン	めぐ.る、めぐ.り	巡る (めぐ.る)
304	car	xa (cái xe)	車	car, sun, ten, needle	7	13	You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, car, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.	* Car, cart, wagon, and vehicle may all be used as primitive meanings.	My car is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.	"Rather than hobbling along with a walking stick to cross through a span, it´s much better to use a car. (Imagine an old man with a walking stick creeping along a span of road, and you, in a car, whizzing right by him. It´s funny ´cause it´s true.) Also, it´s important to include the word ""through,"" so you know the walking stick goes right THROUGH the span."	1	5	シャ	くるま	車 (くるま)
305	take along	Liên (tiếp, hợp)	連	take along, car, road	10	13	What you are meant to take along in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the car on the road should ground your image for picking up your friends to take them along to wherever you are going.		When you put your car on the road you should always take along a few friends. Don´t confuse with carry (#303).	"This kanji also means ""linked"" or ""series"" so I´ve changed the kanji meaning to ""GO ALONG (WITH EACH OTHER)."" Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the ""Union"" in Soviet Union and the ""United"" of United Nations (the countries that ""go along with each other"" at least some of the time)."	4	3	レン	つら.なる、つら.ねる、つ.れる、-づ.れ	連れる (つ.れる), 連なる (つら.なる), 連ねる (つら.ねる)
306	rut	Quỹ (Con đường, các sao hành tinh đi xung quanh mặt trời gọi là quỹ đạo.)	軌	rut, car, nine, baseball	9	13	Combine the primary and secondary meanings of this keyword to form your story. Begin with the car whose tires get caught in a rut and spin without going anywhere. Then go onto the baseball team who can't win a game because it has fallen into a rut of losing.		My car got so stuck in a rut it required nine people pushing to get it out again.	I got my car stuck in a rut ! I´m gonna have to call 999 !	JH	1	キ		
307	transport	Thâu (Chuyển vần, lấy xe vận tải đồ đi.)	輸	transport, car, meeting of butchers, umbrella, one, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber	16	13	"On the left we see a vehicle used for transport. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for meeting. Below it we see the elements for flesh and saber, which combine to create a compound element for a butcher and his trade. Together they give us the image of a ""trucker's convoy."""		The car is a cattle-car, used to transport animals for the butcher´s meeting - a convention on new butchering techniques. Hear the screams of the animals as it pulls up in front of the convention hall, where the butchers are waiting with their knives out front.	The vehicle transports animals for a meeting with the butcher.	5	2	ユ、シュ		
309	in front	Tiền (trước)	前	in front, horns, butcher, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber	9	13	We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the butcher hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's horns placed in front of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for before (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.		When I get horny my flesh sword sticks out in front of me.	If you stand in front of a bull´s horns, you are asking for your flesh to be cut (or butchered if you prefer).	2	5	ゼン	まえ、-まえ	前 (まえ)
311	each	Đều (Đều. Mỗi người có một địa vị riêng, không xâm lấn được.)	各	each, walking legs, mouth	6	13	"""Suum cuique"" goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her mouth between his/her walking legs, giving us an image of ""To each his/her own."""	"* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word ""every,"" which we shall meet later in another context."	Son, I´ve never told you this but each woman has a second mouth between their fiiiiiine walking legs.	Each and every one of us walks and talks differently.	4	2	カク	おのおの	各 (おのおの)
312	status	Cách (tư cách)	格	status, tree, wood, each, walking legs, mouth	10	13	If you can imagine trees as status symbols (as they might well be for those living in Japan's congested cities, where greenery has become something of a luxury item), then each might be aiming to have his/her own tree, just to keep up with the Suzukis.		"Ranger! I want you to go check the status of each tree. ""Errr, Each tree sir?"" replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. ""That´s Right, I want the status of each tree! Move out!""."	A man measures his own status by the size of his woody...and compares it to each one he sees.	5	3	カク、コウ、キャク、ゴウ		格式 (かくしき), 規格 (きかく), 性格 (せいかく)
314	abbreviation	Lược	略	abbreviation, rice field, brains, each, walking legs, mouth	11	13	"Each field has its own abbreviations (chemistry, philosophy, sports, etc.). Needless to say, the ""stronger"" primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around."		There are so many abbreviations and acronyms nowadays that no brain can remember each of them. Mnemonic: ab-brain-each-ation.	A very anal farmer wants to catologue each grain of rice in his rice field. Imagine him scribbling a tiny abbreviation of his name and a number on each grain.	5	2	リャク	ほぼ、おか.す、おさ.める、はかりごと、はか.る、はぶ.く、りゃく.す、りゃく.する	
315	guest	Khách	客	guest, house, each, walking legs, mouth	9	13	When you are a guest in a courteous town, each household has its own way of welcoming you, and each house becomes your home.		Each person under my roof is treated as a guest.	In my house I welcome each guest.	3	3	キャク、カク		客間 (きゃくま), 客車 (きゃくしゃ), 乗客 (じょうきゃく)
316	forehead	Ngạch (Bộ trán, trên chỗ lông mày dưới mái tóc gọi là ngạch)	額	forehead, guest, house, each, walking legs, mouth, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	18	13	As Miss Manners will be the first to tell you, out of respect, one does not look straight into the eyes of one's guests, but focus on the top button of their collar. Here, however, you are told to look above the eyes to the forehead of your guest.		Sign the guestbook page with your forehead. (Picture a guestbook full of forehead prints like thumbprints).	In New Zealand, people welcome guests by touching their foreheads together.	5	2	ガク	ひたい	額 (ひたい)
317	summer	Hạ	夏	summer, one, ceiling, drop, eye, walking legs	10	13	"In the summer, fatigued by the heat, your head hangs down nearly as far as your walking legs, or rather, your ""dragging legs."" Note how the walking legs (instead of ""animal legs"") are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for page (Frame 64)."		In SUMMER you are hot from the top of your head down to your walking legs.	I personally think it was too confusing to try and use head as the primitive. (How am I supposed to remember that the animal legs are replaced with walking legs instead of human legs?) Rather, I think have the image of a hot summer and you want to keep oneself under a ceiling not out jogging around.	2	4	カ、ガ、ゲ	なつ	夏季 (かき), 初夏 (しょか), 盛夏 (せいか), 夏 (なつ)
318	dispose	Xử , xứ	処	dispose, walking legs, wind	5	13	Both the stretching out of the walking legs and the little bit of wind tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or dispose of it.		The best way to dispose of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you.	To dispose of rubbish you should walk it to the bin not throw it to the wind.	6	3	ショ	ところ、-こ、お.る	
319	twig	Điều (cành nhỏ)	条	twig, walking legs, tree, wood	7	13	"Geppetto made walking legs for his little Pinocchio from two twigs of a tree, giving him a set of ""twiggy"" shanks."		They all say they have a TREE between their WALKING LEGS but most only have a TWIG.	Don´t confuse with branch or bough - think of snapping twigs. A twig is always the kind of wood that snaps when the hunter´s walking legs just barely touch it, making a snapping sound that alerts the prey to the hunter´s presence.	5	1	ジョウ、チョウ、デキ	えだ、すじ	
320	fall	Lạc (rụng, lá rụng)	落	fall, flowers, water, water droplets, water pistol, each, walking legs, mouth	12	13	When water falls, it splats and splashes; when flower petals fall, they float gently in the breeze. To each thing its own way of falling.		Water each flower or the petals will wither and fall.	[It´s been suggested on the forum (http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079) that flower across the full width of the kanji and water on the left below it should have its own keyword; seaweed is a popular choice. See also dilute (#227), clan (#1912), seaweed (#2035). This story is for the benefit of those using that idea.] Picture a group of Japanese skydivers falling through the sky -- suddenly each one opens, instead of a parachute, an enormous sheet of nori seaweed to carry them safely down.	3	3	ラク	お.ちる、お.ち、お.とす	落ちる (お.ちる), 落とす (お.とす)
321	superfluous	Nhũng	冗	superfluous, crown, weathercock, wind	4	14	Picture a weather vane beneath a regal crown, spinning round and round. It is not only superfluous but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it.		"The king´s crown was blown off by the wind. ""Oh well,"" he said, ""it´s just a superfluous symbol.""."	"The court jester wears a crown and is full of wind with bad jokes. He is superfluous to the King´s court. This kanji is read as ""JOU"" and commonly used to create the compound for jou-dan 冗談 (jest or joke) hence court jester. Also jou-go 冗語 (redundancy) and jou-in 冗員 (useless workers) 員-employee (#56)."	JH	1	ジョウ		
323	army	Quân	軍	army, chariot, crown, vehicle, car	9	14	"The crowned vehicle depicted here is a ""chariot,"" symbol of an army."	* Used as a primitive this kanji means only chariot.	British army cars are at the service of the crown.	Imagine a crown is the hood ornament on every army car.	4	2	グン		
324	radiance	Huy (rực)	輝	radiance, ray, small, little, human legs, army, chariot, crown, vehicle, car	15	14	Take advantage of the first syllable of the key word to think of the ray of light to the left. Now add the glittering chariot that is emitting those rays and you have radiance.		Rays of light emitted from Apollo´s chariot = radiance. Don´t put the sun into this kanji. The rays are coming from the chariot directly!	Radiance is an army of rays.	JH	1	キ	かがや.く	輝く (かがや.く)
325	carry	Vận	運	carry, army, chariot, crown, vehicle, car, road	12	14	"A long string of ""sweet"" chariots ""swinging low"" to our roads is a sure sign that the Lord is ""comin' for to carry"" someone home."		Don’t confuse it with “take along” (287). In that one, there was a car so you could take along your friends once you found them on the road. In this one, there is an army chariot just to carry military supplies (sorry no room for you).	Roads carry armies (in contrast to seas carrying navies or skies carrying air forces).	3	4	ウン	はこ.ぶ	運ぶ (はこ.ぶ)
326	crown	Quan, quán (cái mũ)	冠	crown, beginning, two, human legs, glue	9	14	By having the crown pass from one age to the next, a people keeps itself glued to its beginnings.		"Remember the SUPERFLUOUS CROWN that flew away in the WIND? Well now the king is saying ""i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING""."	A crown, from the beginning of the new king´s life, is glued to him. He must inherit it.	JH	1	カン	かんむり	冠 (かんむり)
327	dream	Mộng	夢	dream, flowers, eye, cross-eyed, net, crown, evening	13	14	"To have a dream after going to bed is really the crown to a perfect evening. The flower petals over the eyes (instead of the ""sand"" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant dream suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji."		Last night´s date with Miss Sweden was like a dream. She even laid flowers over my eyes to crown the perfect evening.	In the movie American Beauty, Kevin Spacey liked to DREAM about his daughter´s friend and have a rose petal fall onto his eye from the ceiling. He did this lying in his bed each evening. You can almost see him lying in his bed in this kanji.	5	3	ム、ボウ	ゆめ、ゆめ.みる、くら.い	夢 (ゆめ)
328	pit	Khanh (hố)	坑	pit, soil, dirt, ground, whirlwind, top hat, wind	7	14	A whirlwind begins to dig its way into the soil like a drill until it makes a deep pit.		A whirlwind digs a hole in the ground throwing out lots of dirt until it ends up with a giant pit.	Tazmanian Devil whirlwinds a pit into the soil. Note: Take care difference between pit and rut.	JH	1	コウ		
329	tall	Cao	高	tall, top hat, mouth, alien, hood, mouth, mouth2	10	14	Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the mouth under the extraterrestrial's glass hood, and then the mouth under the top hat of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much taller than everyone else.	* As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of tall and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes.	Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and top hat, trying to look TALL. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth.	Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a TALL hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both).	2	5	コウ	たか.い、たか、-だか、たか.まる、たか.める	高 (たか), 高い (たか.い), 高まる (たか.まる), 高める (たか.める)
330	receive	Hưởng	享	receive, tall, top hat, mouth, children	8	14	Tall children receive more attention. Tall children grow up to make better wide receivers. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular tall child in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames.		In basketball however, tall children receive all the attention.	Tall children receive all the attention. They also make great receivers in football... this kanji also means ´catch´ (therefore a football receiver is a great image).	JH	1	キョウ、コウ	う.ける	
331	cram school	Thục (Cái chái nhà. Gian nhà hai bên cửa cái gọi là thục. Là chỗ để cho con em vào học, cho nên gọi chỗ chái học là gia thục)	塾	cram school, receive, tall, top hat, mouth, child, children, round, nine, baseball, drop, soil, dirt, ground	14	14	Cram schools are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the tall children who are out on the school grounds practicing sports, and the fat ones who are out there burning off calories. So this character depicts those who do NOT go to the cram schools, rather than those who do.		Welcome to our cram school: you will receive a rounded education on our grounds.	"You can receive a well-rounded education if you study at our cram school says the advertisement. ""Just come to our school grounds and check it out yourself!""."	JH	1	ジュク		
332	mellow	Thục (Trong thuần thục)	熟	mellow, receive, tall, top hat, mouth, child, children, round, nine, baseball, drop, oven-fire, barbecue	15	14	The tall and fat children from the last frame are here cast into a cauldron over an oven flame until they have sufficiently mellowed that they can return to the normal life of a student.		Imagine tall children sitting round the fire toasting marsh-mellows.	The cram school (309) tortures its students - especially the tall and fat ones who need to grow up - over a fire until they mellow. (Note that here the keyword ´mellow´ only means to mature, ripen, or acquire skill; not the colloquial meaning of ´chill out´).	6	1	ジュク	う.れる	熟れる (う.れる)
333	pavilion	Đình	亭	pavilion, tall, top hat, mouth, crown, street, nail, spike	9	14	Think of all the pavilions at County Fairs or World Expos you have wandered into or seen advertised in the media, and you will no doubt see rising up among them the towering tall crowned nail (the crown being a revolving restaurant) - that architectural monstrosity that has become a symbol of science and technology at such events.		The Pavillion on crown street is the tallest I have ever seen.	The tallest Pavilion crowns the street.	JH	1	テイ、チン		
334	capital	Kinh	京	capital, tall, top hat, mouth, small, little	8	14	When we think of a capital city today we think of tall skyscrapers dwarfing the endless swarms of little folk scurrying here and there about their business.		Tokyo, capital of Japan: tall buildings, small people (compared to the buildings).	The capital is where the powerful act formal wearing top hats, open their mouths, and get little done.	2	4	キョウ、ケイ、キン	みやこ	
335	refreshing	Lương (Lạnh, mát. Như lương thủy)	涼	refreshing, water droplets, water pistol capital, tall, top hat, mouth, small, little	11	14	Since few things are as refreshing on a warm day as a cool shower (the water), here we picture an entire capital city treating itself to one, and in full view of everyone.		When you´re a tourist in the capital during the heat of summer, finding a water fountain is oh, so refreshing.	The water from the capital of Japan, Tokyo, is so refreshing!	JH	2	リョウ	すず.しい、すず.む、すず.やか、うす.い、ひや.す、まことに	涼しい (すず.しい), 涼む (すず.む)
336	scenery	Cảnh	景	scenery, sun, day, capital, tall, top hat, mouth, small, little	12	14	Scenery is depicted as a sun rising over a capital city, which is a bit of natural scenery the city dwellers themselves rarely get to see!		Imaging the sun rising over the capital--classic postcard scenery.	Anyone who´s been to Kyoto doesn´t need to think too deeply into this Kanji! Imagine a sunny day in the old capital, and there´s no better scenery.	4	3	ケイ		
337	whale	Kình	鯨	whale, fish, bound up, rice field, brains, oven-fire, barbecue, capital, tall, top hat, mouth, small, little	19	14	The whale swallows a whole school of fish, who turn their new abode into a proper little fish-capital.		If fish were cities, the whale would surely be the capital.	When the whale was first discovered it was the biggest fish people had ever seen. Stories exaggerated its size - people said it was as big as the entire capital city!	JH	1	ゲイ	くじら	鯨 (くじら)
338	cottage	XÁ	舎	cottage, umbrella, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth	8	14	A lidded crock with an umbrella overhead gives us a mixture of the modern and the nostalgic in this design for a cottage.		The cottage is so small - it has an umbrella for the roof; soil for the floor and room for only one mouth.	My vacation cottage is nothing but a hole in the ground covered by an umbrella.	5	1	シャ、セキ	やど.る	
339	circumference	Chu (Vòng, khắp một vòng tròn)	周	circumference, glass hood, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth	8	14	Look more closely at your lidded crock and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the circumference of your motorcycle helmet: just begin at a fixed point and turn the lidded crock around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the helmet, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your lidded crock made, you now know the circumference.	* As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a lap.	If my LIDDED CROCK has the same CIRCUMFERENCE as my head, I like to use it as a HELMET.	You´re at a motorcycle store looking to buy a helmet. The only way to check the circumference of your head is to put increasingly larger lidded crocks on your head until one slips on just right. Now you know what size helmet to buy.	4	2	シュウ	まわ.り	周り (まわ.り)
340	week	Chu (Một tuần lễ gọi là nhất chu.)	週	week, circumference, running track, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, road	11	14	Picture a circular road with 7 markers on it, one for each day of the week. When you have walked one complete lap on this road, you shall have completed one week.		Imagine a road built so well that it takes only a week to travel the circumference of the earth.	Actually the week is like a never ending road where we travel in a circle through the same seven days again and again, the circumference is always the same. circumference (#317) also means circuit or lap, so that also makes think about the rotations of the moon, sun and the earth -- all important for measuring all kinds of time periods.	2	4	シュウ		
341	gentleman	Sĩ	士	gentleman, gentleman, samurai	3	14	The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for soil by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's gentlemen.	* The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the samurai, Japan's warrior class.	What a handsome gentleman. Standing up so straight, and broad shoulders too!! He´s like a modern samurai!	A gentleman has broad shoulders and doesn´t soil himself.	4	1	シ		
342	good luck	Cát (Tốt lành. Phàm việc gì vui mừng đều gọi là cát, đối lại với chữ hung 凶. Như cát tường = điềm lành.)	吉	good luck, samurai, mouth	6	14	Here we see a samurai standing on a street with an open mouth, which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for good luck.	* As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an aerosol can, from the mouth and the very tightly-fitting lid (note how it differs here from the lidded crock).	The samurai´s wife gives him a (uhum) before battle for good luck.	"A true samurai gentleman will always mouth, ""Good luck"" to his opponents before a match."	JH	1	キチ、キツ	よし	吉日 (きちじつ), 吉例 (きちれい), 大吉 (だいきち)
343	robust	Tráng	壮	robust, turtle, samurai	6	14	Robust is seen as a turtle turned samurai.		Half of a turtle shell as a shield makes a samurai more robust.	The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are robust gentlemen aren´t they?	JH	1	ソウ	さかん	
344	villa	TRANG (biệt thự, trang trại, nghiêm trang)	荘	villa, flowers, robust, turtle, samurai	9	14	The villa pictured here is filled with exotic flowers at every turn, and has a pair of turtle-samurai standing before its gates.		A villa is fancier (decorated with flowers) and more robust than the average.	The teenage mutant samurai turtles live in a villa with flowers on the roof so that the neighbours don´t get suspicious.	JH	1	ソウ、ショウ、チャン	ほうき、おごそ.か	
345	sell	MẠI	売	sell, samurai, paper punch, Miss World, crown, human legs	7	14	A samurai, out of a job, is going door-to-door selling little windup crowns with human legs that run around on the floor looking like headless monarchs.		The samurai happened to find an extra large crown that he wore as a belt on his waist, just above his legs. I wonder if he will sell it to me?	"A ""samurai"" will never sell his ""crown"" (king), even it meant having both his ""human legs"" chopped off!"	2	4	バイ	う.る、う.れる	売る (う.る), 売れる (う.れる)
346	study	Học	学	study, schoolhouse, owl, crown, child	8	15	The child in the little red schoolhouse is there for one reason only: to study. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that study is one thing and learning quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for learning (Frame 616) has nothing to do with the schoolhouse.		In the school house there are kids always studying. (BTW, atomiton, this is NOT 字).	Children in schoolhouses are there to study, nothing else!!!	1	5	ガク	まな.ぶ	学ぶ (まな.ぶ)
347	memorize	GIÁC (cảm giác, giác ngộ)	覚	memorize, schoolhouse, owl, crown, see, telescope, eye, human legs	12	15	The idea of memorizing things is easily related to the schoolhouse; and since we have been at it for more than a hundred pages in this book, the idea that memorizing involves seeing things that are not really there should make it easy to put the two elements together.		In a schoolhouse in class: 1) you see something on the blackboard, then 2) you memorize it.	You´ll never memorize all the kanji by seeing them in a school house. You need Heisig and RtK!	4	3	カク	おぼ.える、さ.ます、さ.める、さと.る	覚える (おぼ.える), 覚ます (さ.ます), 覚める (さ.める)
348	flourish	VINH	栄	flourish, schoolhouse, owl, crown, tree, wood	9	15	The botanical connotations of the word flourish (to bud and burst into bloom, much as a tree does) are part of the ideal of the schoolhouse as well.		The TREES FLOURISH in the CLASSROOM, a little too much perhaps, there´s no room for the students any more.	Students are like young trees. They tend to flourish in the schoolhouse.	4	2	エイ、ヨウ	さか.える、は.え、-ば.え、は.える、え	栄える (さか.える), 栄え (は.え), 栄える (は.える)
349	write	Thư	書	write, brush, tongue wagging, sun, day	10	15	The sage talks rapidly with his tongue wagging in his mouth, while the brush of the scribe runs apace to write down the master 'swords.		Make sure you practice writing kanji with a brush every day before the sun goes down.	The calligrapher had a peculiar habit: when using her brush to write, she would stick out her tongue, just slightly.	2	5	ショ	か.く、-が.き、-がき	書く (か.く)
350	haven	Tân (bến)	津	haven, water, water droplets, water pistol, brush	9	15	Seeing the tiny boats of poor mortals tossed about in a stormy sea like so many corks, the All-Merciful took its brush and drew little inlets of water where the hapless creatures might seek shelter. And so it is that we have havens.		A brush laying in dirty water is a haven for bacteria.	The haven for a BRUSH is in WATER.. Otherwise they get dry and withered and cant be used?!	JH	1	シン	つ	津 (つ)
351	breed	Mục (Kẻ chăn giống muông.)	牧	breed, cow, taskmaster	8	15	When it is time to breed new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the cow is often not. Thus the taskmaster to the right forces the cow into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can breed.		"Imagine a taskmaster giving a cow the command to ""start breeding, and start doing it now!"", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to breed with. Hence, you see the taskmaster running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the cow."	Hint: This is the kanji from which taskmaster is derived. Actually, this kanji has nothing to do with breed, and a lot to do with pastures and shepherds (also for cowboys, japanese and spanish don´t differenciate between animals). Think of a cowboy (taskmaster) who brings his cows to the pasture.	4	1	ボク	まき	牧 (まき)
352	aggression	Công	攻	aggression, craft, taskmaster	7	15	The special craft of successful taskmasters is their ability to remain constantly on the aggressive, never allowing their underlings a moment to ponder a counter-aggression of their own.		Aggression is the craft of a good dominatrix.	AGGRESSION is a well-honed craft for any decent taskmaster.	JH	1	コウ	せ.める	攻める (せ.める)
353	failure	Bại	敗	failure, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, taskmaster	11	15	The taskmaster is acknowledging the failure of a clam to make the grade in some marine school or other.		If you end up in failure, you give money to the taskmaster to train you.	The shell who was defeated before (defeat (#63)) is being chastised by the taskmaster for his failure to win.	4	3	ハイ	やぶ.れる	敗れる (やぶ.れる)
354	a sheet of	Mai (tờ)	枚	sheet of…, tree, wood, taskmaster	8	15	English counts thin, flat objects, like bed linen and paper, in sheets. The kanji does this with a taskmaster whipping a tree into producing sheets against its will.		The taskmaster is a strict bathroom monitor who hands out only one sheet of really rough, splintery toilet paper per person. You can see the wood fibers.	This taskmaster is the bathroom nazi: he counts how many sheets of toilet paper and tissue you use, and then tells you what % of a tree you just killed.	6	2	マイ、バイ		
355	happenstance	Cố	故	happenstance, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth, taskmaster	9	15	Call it fate or providence or plain old Lady Luck, happenstance is the oldest taskmaster we know. It nearly always has its way.		An OLD TASKMASTER is no happenstance (coincidence). The older you get the more rigid in your ways.	Need to disambiguate from enemy (#443) as it´s easy to mix up antique and old here. Let´s think of an accidental president -- he is an old taskmaster who has managed to win the election by happenstance .	5	1	コ	ゆえ、ふる.い、もと	故 (ゆえ)
356	awe	Kính	敬	awe, flowers, phrase, bound up, mouth, taskmaster	12	15	"Standing in awe of someone, you get self-conscious and may try to speak in flowery phrases out of veneration or fear. The taskmaster at the right is drilling you in the practice of your ""honorifics."""		The flowery phrases of the schoolmaster held the students in awe.	敬 【けい】 (n) reverence; respect. 敬語 【けいご】 (n) honorific; term of respect; (P) STORY: The TASKMASTER demands RESPECT. If you don´t talk to him in HONORIFICS and FLOWERY PHRASES you will be sorry.	6	2	ケイ、キョウ	うやま.う	敬う (うやま.う)
357	say	Ngôn	言	say, words, keitai, mouth	7	15	Of all the things we can do with our mouths, speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for say has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement.	* This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean saying, speech, or words, depending on which is most useful.	A pictogram of someone saying a four letter word from their mouth after the censors have gotten a hold of it.	This is simple a pictogram of a mouth SAYing something. The lines are soundwaves. No need to complicate it.	2	4	ゲン、ゴン	い.う、こと	言行 (げんこう), 言論 (げんろん), 宣言 (せんげん), 言う (い.う), 言 (こと)
358	admonish	Cảnh	警	admonish, awe, flowers, phrase, bound up, mouth, taskmaster, say, words, keitai, mouth, mouth2	19	15	Here you have a perfect example of how an apparently impossible snarl of strokes becomes a snap to learn once you know its elements. The idea of being admonished for something already sets up a superior-inferior relationship between you and the person you are supposed to stand in awe of. While you are restricted to answering in honorifics, the superior can use straightforward and ordinary words.		To admonish is to enforce awe by means of words.	Watch in awe as mom admonishes the rude clerk with words that you´ve never heard her use before.	6	3	ケイ	いまし.める	
359	plot	Kế	計	plot, say, words, keitai, mouth, ten, needle	9	15	Words and a meter's needle combine to form the sense of plot: to talk over plans and to calculate a course of action.		A plot is a summary of a book that can be given in ten words.	Say-ten´s (satan´s) evil plot.	2	4	ケイ	はか.る、はか.らう	計らう (はか.らう), 計る (はか.る)
361	prison	Ngục	獄	prison, pack of wild dogs, say, words, keitai, mouth, chihuahua, dog, large, drop	14	15	Although we did not make note of it at the time, the kanji for dog is also a low-grade term for a spy. And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with dogs. The prison here depicts a pack of wild dogs (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little chihuahua (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened words.		The wild dog family visits their cousin in prison. They exchange words over the interphone at the visiting booth.	The only thing keeping the new chihuahua inmate from being ´initiated´ by the pack of wild dogs were his quick words in prison.	JH	1	ゴク		
362	revise	Đính (Hai bên bàn bạc với nhau cho kĩ rồi mới thỏa thuận gọi là đính. )	訂	revise, say, words, keitai, mouth, street, nail, spike	9	15	"After completing the first draft, you revise it by nailing down your words and ""hammering"" them into shape."		Revise, revise and revise until you have all the words nailed down.	Remember how Martin Luther revised the words of the catholic church and nailed his 95 Theses at the door of the church in Wittenberg?	JH	1	テイ		
364	chastise	Thảo (Đánh, đánh giết kẻ có tội gọi)	討	chastise, say, words, keitai, mouth, glue	10	15	Words spoken to chastise us stick to us like glue in a way no other words can.		I said some bad words, and my mother chastised me by washing my mouth out with glue instead of soap!	"In Colonial New England, people who committed adultery had words glued to them. A famous example is the ""A"" worn by Hester Prynn for committing adultery (i.e., not being chaste). In this way, words glued to you are supposed to chastise you and prevent further breaches of chastity."	6	1	トウ	う.つ	討つ (う.つ)
365	instruction	Huấn	訓	instruction, say, words, keitai, mouth, stream, flood	10	15	"The personalism connoted by the word instruction, as opposed to ""teaching"" or ""discipline,"" suits the picture here of words guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a stream. Even the etymology of the word instruction suggests the sense of ""pouring into""."		The best type of Japanese INSTRUCTION is full immersion, which consists of going to Japan and swimming in the stream of words that surrounds you every day.	Listen carefully to the words of instruction before you try swimming in the river.	4	2	クン、キン	おし.える、よ.む、くん.ずる	
366	imperial edict	Chiếu	詔	imperial edict, say, words, keitai, mouth, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth, mouth2	12	15	The imperial edict, spoken with the force of unquestionable law, is made up of words intended to seduce the masses - be it through fear or respect - to follow obediently.		"The mnemonic ""words to seduce the masses"" was just too vague and I kept forgetting it. So now instead I picture a seductive female reading aloud the imperial edict to the masses, thus ""seducing"" the masses."	The emperor did not need an imperial edict; his words were more than enough to seduce Anakin to the dark side.	JH	1	ショウ	みことのり	詔 (みことのり)
367	packed	Cật (Hỏi vặn.)	詰	packed, say, words, keitai, mouth, aerosol, good luck, samurai, mouth, mouth2	13	15	"A piece of writing that is pregnant with meaning and needs to be reread several times to be understood we refer to colloquially as ""packed."" The character sees the words as sealed tightly inside an aerosol can."		WORDS of GOOD LUCK are PACKED into fortune cookies.	Nowadays, grafitti comes pre-packaged. The factory takes a bunch of words and aerosol cans and then makes sure the words get tightly packed inside. All you have to do is spray and everything takes care of itself!	JH	2	キツ、キチ	つ.める、つ.め、-づ.め、つ.まる、つ.む	詰まる (つ.まる), 詰む (つ.む), 詰める (つ.める)
368	tale	Thoại (Lời nói, phàm các lời nói tầm thường đều gọi là thoại.)	話	tale, say, words, keitai, mouth, tongue, thousand, mouth, mouth2	13	15	"That the words of the tongue should come to mean a tale is clear from the etymology: a tale is something ""talked,"" not something read from a book."		Tales are always spoken, not written, and because of this, words fly out of your tongue, rather than your pen.	Tales are spoken words, passed on from person to person, eventually being spoken by a thousand mouths.	2	5	ワ	はな.す、はなし	話す (はな.す), 話 (はなし)
369	recitation	Vịnh (Ngâm vịnh, đọc văn thơ đến chỗ có âm điệu phải kéo dài giọng đọc ra gọi là vịnh.)	詠	recitation, say, words, keitai, mouth, eternity, drop, water	12	15	Listening to the words of poets reciting their poetry is like being transported for a moment into eternity where the rules of everyday life have been suspended.		Listening to the words in a recitation of Vogon poetry is worse than spending an eternity in hell. [Note: I assume those 2 reports are to warn against possible confusion with poem (#346) but how can you confuse Vogon poetry with an actual poem? Anyway, it´s the next frame, so it should be easy to keep them straight... Or maybe there´s a kanji for Vogon in RTK3?].	If you study some words for a recitation, there is a good chance they will be stuck in your memory for all eternity.	JH	1	エイ	よ.む、うた.う	詠む (よ.む)
370	poem	Thi	詩	poem, say, words, keitai, mouth, Buddhist temple, soil, dirt, ground, glue	13	15	Since silence is treasured so highly at a Buddhist temple the words spoken there must be well-chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like poems. Before going on, back up a frame and make sure you have kept poem and recitation distinct in your mind.		A poem is a temple of words.	WORDS used in a TEMPLE must be very well chosen. That´s why most people will speak using a poem if they are SAYING something in a TEMPLE.	3	1	シ	うた	
371	word	Ngữ	語	word, say, words, keitai, mouth, I, five, mouth, mouth2	14	15	Whereas the character for say focused on the actual talking, that for words stresses the fact that although it is I who say them, the words of a language are not my own. You can see the clear distinction between I and words just by looking at the kanji.		The simplest word to say is I.	May I say a word about that?	2	5	ゴ	かた.る、かた.らう	語らう (かた.らう), 語る (かた.る)
372	read	ĐỘC	読	read, say, words, keitai, mouth, sell, sale, samurai, paper punch, Miss World, crown, human legs	14	15	In the age of advertising, most words we read are out to sell some product or point of view.		Read the WORDS used to SELL things.	People will say (言) almost anything to make a sale (売); don´t believe everything you read (読).	2	5	ドク、トク、トウ	よ.む、-よ.み	読書 (どくしょ), 音読 (おんどく), 購読 (こうどく), 読本 (どくほん), 読む (よ.む)
373	tune	Điệu	調	tune, say, words, keitai, mouth, circumference, running track, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, mouth2	15	15	A complete tune is composed not only of a succession of notes but also of one lap of the words that go with it.		To tune an old-fashioned radio, you turn the dial the full range of the circumference, until you can clearly hear what´s being said.	words + circumference The most catchy tunes are words the go round and round the circuference of your head and you can´t get it out of your mind.	3	3	チョウ	しら.べる、しら.べ、ととの.う、ととの.える	調べる (しら.べる), 調う (ととの.う), 調える (ととの.える)
374	discuss	Đàm	談	discuss, say, words, keitai, mouth, inflammation, fire, fire2	15	15	"In almost every attempt to discuss an issue, the fervor of one's convictions comes to the surface and creates an inflammation of words (if you will, the ""cuss"" in discuss)."		Think of an online discussion group where misunderstanding someone´s words leads to flaming. An angry discussion = inflamed words.	Internet discussions often involve inflammatory words. Flame war!	3	3	ダン		
375	consent	Nặc (Vâng, ừ, ưng cho.)	諾	consent, say, words, keitai, mouth, young, flowers, by one’s side, mouth, mouth2	15	15	"The words of the young do not have legal validity unless backed up by ""parental consent."""		The words of the very young are useless without CONSENT from their elders.	"Delores might say, ""Yes!"", but she´s way too young give any legal consent."	JH	1	ダク		
376	rebuke	Dụ (Cảnh báo)	諭	rebuke, say, words, keitai, mouth, meeting of butchers, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber	16	15	"The stern tone of a rebuke is seen here in the image of words spoken at a meeting of butchers (See frame 307) waving their choppers at one another and ""cutting one another down"" as only butchers can."		A PETA activist speaks at a meeting of butchers to rebuke them.	I imagine Socrates gate-crashing a meeting of butchers and REBUKING them: ´You´ve been killing things again; you have, haven´t you?´ while the embarrassed butchers blush and try to hide their knives behind their backs and stand in front of hanging sides of beef.	JH	1	ユ	さと.す	諭す (さと.す)
377	style	Thức	式	style, arrow, craft	6	16	"Take style in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element arrow and craft stand for the well-known style of shirts known as ""Arrow shirts"" because of the little arrow sewn on each one."		Each Indian tribe crafts their arrows in a certain style..	The latest style is shirts crafted out of arrows.	3	3	シキ		
378	test	Thí (thử)	試	test, say, words, keitai, mouth, style, arrow, craft	13	16	When a manufacturer produces a new style for the market, the first thing that is done is to run a test on consumers, asking them to speak their opinions frankly about the product. Never mind the anachronism (the kanji was there well before our capitalistic market system) if it helps you remember.		In an essay test, you are judged on both your choice of words and your writing style.	The Japanese oral exam was a test of my speaking style.	4	4	シ	こころ.みる、ため.す	試みる (こころ.みる), 試す (ため.す)
379	II (two)	NHỊ	弐	II, two, arrows, quiver	6	16	We use the Roman numeral II here to stress that this kanji is an older form of the kanji for two. Think of two arrows in a quiver, standing up like the numeral II.		II (older form of writing 2). After shooting one arrow (the dash top left), I have 2 arrows left in my quiver (bottom left).	Once you have two old arrows left in your quiver, you better start running...!	JH	1	ニ、ジ	ふた.つ、そえ	
380	range	Vực	域	range, soil, dirt, ground, pope, fiesta, mouth, one, floor	11	16	From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a range has also come to mean a grazing land where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming fiesta like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the range, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the mouth on the floor), and then get on with the fiesta.		An astronaut lands back at the launch range, kisses the earth beneath him with his mouth, then heads off to a fiesta to celebrate a safe flight.	"Instead of Heisig´s ""Fiesta"" I use ""Spear"". Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域, range actually means range as in limits/boundary/border sort of range(In a box it was the old meaning for Country國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the RANGE of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear´s have range)."	6	2	イキ		
381	burglar	Tặc	賊	burglar, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, ten, needle, fiesta	13	16	From a burglar's point of view, a fiesta is an occasion to takeout the old lock picking needle and break into the unattended safe filled with the family shells (the old form of money, as we saw in frames 84 and 206).		Burglars... those guys!!! Burglars only want money (clams) so that they can get needles (drugs) and party (fiesta)!	After the fiesta, we found out that some burglar had stolen our money, probably breaking in with a lockpick needle...	JH	1	ゾク		
382	plantation	Tài (trồng)	栽	plantation, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, tree, wood	10	16	On a fruit plantation it is the trees that one is particularly grateful for at the time of Thanksgiving. Imagine yourself inviting a few representative trees from the fields and orchards to join you around the table to give thanks.		The plantation is where we get our Christmas trees. We pick them out at Thanksgiving to be sure we get a good one.	During Thanksgiving, all the trees on the plantation celebrate the harvest. It´s a good time for them, too.	JH	1	サイ		
383	load	Tải, Tái (nâng)	載	load, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, car, vehicle	13	16	One loads bales on a wagon or cart in preparation for the great Hay Ride that follows the Thanksgiving dinner each year.		After eating a big Thanksgiving dinner, you have to be careful in the car ride home not to drop a load in your pants.	After ´Thanksgiving´ dinner, my girlfriend gave me a BJ on the drive back home. I blew my ´load´ and ´soiled´ the ´car´. But it was LOADS of fun! Please report this story if this makes you feel uncomfortable :).	JH	1	サイ	の.せる、の.る	載せる (の.せる), 載る (の.る)
384	overgrown	Mậu (tốt, cây cỏ tốt tươi)	茂	overgrown, flowers, parade	8	16	The sense of the key word overgrown is of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess - in this case a whole parade of weeds (outcast flowers). By way of exception, the flowers take their normal place over the enclosure.		The gay parade looks astonishing, as if overgrown with flowers.	When your garden gets OVERGROWN, it´s like the plants are mocking you. Here, you can see the roses actually parading around the yard, wilfully choking out the other, more docile plants. Then they actually go and parade down the street!	JH	1	モ	しげ.る	茂る (しげ.る)
386	turn into	Thành	成	turn into, parade, sword, dagger	6	16	"Let the phrase ""turn into"" suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the parade marching down main street turns into a dagger-throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change."		It only takes a single stroke of a dagger for a parade to TURN INTO a bloodbath.	The gay parade suddenly TURNED INTO a DAGGER throwing fight.	4	3	セイ、ジョウ	な.る、な.す、-な.す	成功 (せいこう), 完成 (かんせい), 賛成 (さんせい), 成す (な.す), 成る (な.る)
387	castle	Thành	城	castle, soil, dirt, ground, turn into, parade, sword, dagger	9	16	In this frame, we see a mound of dirt that is being turned into a castle (the way you may have done as a child playing on the beach).		The sand castle is just the soil (#150) that turns into a castle.	Someday this mound of dirt here will turn into our CASTLE, the ants think to themselves when scoping out a new ant hill.	6	2	ジョウ	しろ	城 (しろ)
388	sincerity	Thành (thực)	誠	sincerity, say, words, keitai, mouth, turn into, sword, dagger, parade	13	16	The sure sign of sincerity is that one's mere words are turned into deeds.		Sincerity happens when what you say actually turns into something.	Sincerity is turning your words into actions.	6	1	セイ	まこと	誠 (まこと)
389	intimidate	Uy (oai)	威	intimidate, march, women, woman	9	16	Here we see a march of women demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, something extremely intimidating to the male chauvinist population.		The march of women - against intimidation in the workplace - is pretty intimidating in itself!	"Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of ""dignity"" and ""threaten."" I can see how a march of women in Japan would be seen as intimidating by most men."	JH	1	イ	おど.す、おど.し、おど.かす	
390	destroy	Diệt	滅	destroy, water, water droplets, water pistol, march, fire	13	16	Picture a march of flames demonstrating against the Fire Department for their right to destroy, but being doused with water by the police riot squads.		Water flows down to destroy the march of fire.	"Use a water cannon to destroy a line of marching fire monsters. I keep mixing this one up with disaster (#167) and demolition (#400). Remember, you DESTROY monsters (think of the Godzilla movie ""Destroy All Monsters!""). Fires and floods are natural DISASTERs. And DEMOLITION is something you carefully do while wearing protective garments. (vaguely based on stefanot´s balrog story)."	JH	1	メツ	ほろ.びる、ほろ.ぶ、ほろ.ぼす	滅びる (ほろ.びる), 滅ぼす (ほろ.ぼす)
391	dwindle	Giảm	減	dwindle, water, water droplets, water pistol, march, mouth	12	16	A group of unquenchable mouths sets out on a march across the country, drinking water wherever they find it until the water supply has dwindled to a trickle, triggering a national disaster.		When WATER was tossed on the PROTESTORS (a march of mouths), the numbers began to DWINDLE.	When water supplies dwindled, the population became a horde of dry mouths, marching to seize the water in the neighboring kingdom.	5	2	ゲン	へ.る、へ.らす	減らす (へ.らす), 減る (へ.る)
393	scaffold	SẠN (Giá để đồ)	桟	scaffold, tree, wood, float, fiesta	10	16	Prior to the use of metal, trees were once cut down and bound together for use as scaffolding material. In the case of this kanji, what is being constructed is not a skyscraper but a simple float.		Japanese festival floats are often so tall they need wood scaffolds to be completed. (http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html).	You need a SCAFFOLD made of WOOD to build a FLOAT if it will be several stories high.	JH	1	サン、セン	かけはし	
394	coin	TIỀN	銭	coin, metal, gold, float, fiesta	14	16	Those special gold-colored tokens minted each year for the Mardi Gras and thrown into the crowds from people on the floats give us the kanji for coins.		Political hopefuls in Rome threw gold COINS from floats when they were campaigning for office.	Interesting fact: The Japanese one yen coin is the only coin in the world that can float on water. http://www.hanamiweb.com/floatingyen.jpg.	5	1	セン、ゼン	ぜに、すき	銭 (ぜに)
395	shallow	Thiển	浅	shallow, water, water droplets, water pistol, float, fiesta	9	16	An entourage of floats going from one town to the next must always seek a shallow place to cross the water. Try to picture what happens if they don't.		The water can´t be too SHALLOW if you expect to float.	The water isn´t shallow enough to ford (#372). We´ll have to cross by float!	4	2	セン	あさ.い	浅い (あさ.い)
396	stop	Chỉ (dừng lại)	止	stop, footprint	4	17	The character for stop is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint: the first 3 strokes represent the front of the foot and the last the heel. The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot.	* Although the meaning of stop will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of footprint.	If you find in the ground a walking stick with a magic wand, STOP! Maybe it´s some kind of macumba/black magic/voodoo bad thing.	If you don´t remember this one from the 10,000,000 STOP signs on roads all over Japan, you´re beyyond help!	2	4	シ	と.まる、-ど.まり、と.める、-と.める、-ど.め、とど.める、とど.め、とど.まる、や.める、や.む、-や.む、よ.す、-さ.す、-さ.し	止まる (と.まる), 止める (と.める)
397	walk	BỘ	歩	walk, stop, footprint, few	8	17	Footprints that follow one another a few at a time indicate walking.		When walking your pet, you must stop a few times along the way when nature calls.	When you learn to walk, you take your steps a few at a time. Picture a clumsy but happy toddler who falls every few steps but keeps getting up to try again.	2	4	ホ、ブ、フ	ある.く、あゆ.む	歩道 (ほどう), 徒歩 (とほ), 進歩 (しんぽ), 歩合 (ぶあい), 日歩 (ひぶ), 歩む (あゆ.む), 歩く (ある.く)
398	ford	THIỆP	渉	ford, water, water droplets, water pistol, walk, stop, footprint, few	11	17	To ford a body of water means to walk across it.		The new Ford Jesus. It can do everything except WALK on WATER.	A ford is a place where one can walk through the water, a place only a few footsteps deep.	JH	1	ショウ	わた.る	
399	repeatedly	Tần (luôn)	頻	repeatedly, walk, stop, footprint, few, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	17	17	The image of something occurring repeatedly, over and over again, is of having one's head walked on.		I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head. I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head. I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head. I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head. I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head.	"Are you familiar with the joke about the ditzy secretary who repeatedly walked back and forth forcibly over all the pages of her boss´ most important letters. When confronted she just says ""Well you said they needed to be stamped before they´re mailed.""."	JH	1	ヒン	しき.りに	
400	agreement	Khẳng (uh đc)	肯	agreement, stop, footprint, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	8	17	Seeing footprints on someone's flesh indicates a rather brutal way of having secured that person's agreement.		A secret agreement between a covert gov´t agency and aliens states that we will not step foot on the moon again in return for alien technology.	NASA and Armstrong made an agreement: They´d never tell anyone that no-one actually stepped foot on the moon.	JH	2	コウ	がえんじ.る	
401	undertake	Xí (ngóng)	企	undertake, umbrella, stop, footprint	6	17	To undertake a project is to take some idea floating in the air and stop it so that it can be brought down to earth and become a reality. Here we see some undertaking made to stop under a beach umbrella.		I will UNDERTAKE this project: To sell UMBRELLAS in a bus STOP.	The Undertaker is an evil WWE wrestler - he beat his opponent with an umbrella until he stopped moving.	JH	1	キ	くわだ.てる、たくら.む	企てる (くわだ.てる)
402	curriculum	Lịch (lý lịch, lịch sử)	歴	curriculum, cliff, grove, tree, wood, stop, footprint, tree2, wood2	14	17	That same grove of trees we met in frame 226 shows up here in the character for curriculum (in the sense of a record of one's life or academic achievements, the curriculum vitae). Instead of the grove making its way slowly through the surface of the cliff as before, here we see it stopped, much the same as a curriculum vitae calls a halt to the calendar and talks only about the past.		A CURRICULUM is a calendar that replaces days with reasons to stop having fun.	A little like a calendar, your CV records your footsteps through time.	4	2	レキ、レッキ		
403	warrior	Vũ, Võ, đối lại với văn	武	warrior, one, arrow, stop, footprint	8	17	With a quiver of arrows set on one's back, the goal of the warrior depicted here is not to attack but merely to stop the attack of others: the oldest excuse in history!		ONE-ARROW can STOP a warrior.	A great warrior can stop any 0pponent with one arrow.	5	2	ブ、ム	たけ.し	武力 (ぶりょく), 武士 (ぶし), 文武 (ぶんぶ)
404	levy	Phú (thu thuế)	賦	levy, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, warrior, one, hstop, footprint, arrow	15	17	A certain portion of shells (money) is collected by the warrior from the local villages as he passes through to defray the costs of keeping the land safe, and this is called a levy.		A warrior stands guard at a bridge collecting shells as a levy for any who want to pass.	Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry. And those good old warrior boys, drinking whiskey and rye, said pay up the clams or you´ll die. Pay up the clams or you´ll die....	JH	1	フ、ブ		
405	correct	Chánh (phải, chánh đáng)	正	correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint	5	17	"""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,"" says the Chinese proverb. Here we see one footprint, complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made correctly, the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in correcting their students, and parents in correcting their children."		If you do it correct on the first attempt you can stop.	The correct way of learning Japanese? First, stop everything you´re doing. Then, go pick up a copy of Heisig´s book and work from there.	1	4	セイ、ショウ	ただ.しい、ただ.す、まさ、まさ.に	正義 (せいぎ), 正誤 (せいご), 訂正 (ていせい), 正しい (ただ.しい), 正す (ただ.す), 正 (まさ)
406	evidence	Chứng	証	evidence, say, words, keitai, mouth, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint	12	17	"Words that testify to the correctness of some fact are classified as evidence. (Here we see a good example of how the more common primitive element takes the ""strong"" position to the left, even though it has more strokes.)"		Your words must be absolutely correct if you plan to use them as evidence.	If what you say is indeed correct, we could use use your testimony as evidence.	5	1	ショウ	あかし	証 (あかし)
407	politics	Chính, chánh	政	politics, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint, taskmaster	9	17	To the many definitions for politics that already exist, this character offers yet another: correct taskmastering. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that politics has to do with taskmastering, maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed correctly if only the right candidate is given a chance.		Those involved in politics are always trying to elect the correct taskmaster.	Insane political correctness on the left, and facists taskmasters on the right- thats politics in a nutshell right there.	5	3	セイ、ショウ	まつりごと、まん	政治 (せいじ), 行政 (ぎょうせい), 家政 (かせい), 政 (まつりごと)
408	determine	Định	定	determine, house, mend	8	17	Determination, in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to mending one's house.		In The Karate Kid, the boy must prove his determination by MENDING his teacher´s HOUSE in various ways.	"People who decide to renovate (ooh, that´s a fancy word, let´s say ""mend"") their houses must be very determined DIYers. (Using DIY helps me remember this story when I see DEtermine)."	3	3	テイ、ジョウ	さだ.める、さだ.まる、さだ.か	定価 (ていか), 安定 (あんてい), 決定 (けってい), 定か (さだ.か), 定まる (さだ.まる), 定める (さだ.める)
409	lock	Đĩnh (thoi vàng, thoi bạc)	錠	lock, metal, gold, determine, determined, house, mend	16	17	Metal of itself doesn't lock. It needs to be so determined by a locksmith. Now make a concrete image of that.		Even if you lock up your GOLD, a DETERMINED thief will get it in the end.	The best stories for this kanji tend to have a thief in them, which always makes me confuse them with the kanji for burglar (357). So, let´s try this one: My girlfriend wears a metal chastity belt with a lock but I am determined to open it! I must get inside!	JH	1	ジョウ		
410	run	Tẩu	走	run, soil, dirt, ground, mend	7	17	Running, we are told here, mends the soil. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for road does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.		Hint: This kanji is NOT soil on top of mend, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is 10 on top of mend. So my story is: If you run 10 miles, you will need to mend your socks!	The sports ground needs MENDING after the game as the players have been RUNNING around which has caused the ground to be chopped up.	2	4	ソウ	はし.る	走る (はし.る)
411	transcend	Siêu	超	transcend, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth	12	17	When one is running after something, the goal that seduces one is said to transcend the seeker.		A successful marathon runner needs to be able to transcend seductions, such as the possibility of rest, shelter from the rain, or a cold beer.	To transcend oneself is to reach a higher plane of reality. A head shaven monk is telling me this. We are in a Tibetan monastery. He was once an athlete, a runner. He used to run everywhere, until one day, he saw a beautiful cheerleader along his path. She tried very hard to seduce him, but he forced himself to transcend his urges. He did reach his running goal, and he has became a lonely monk. He wishes now he had just broken down back then and....	JH	2	チョウ	こ.える、こ.す	超える (こ.える), 超す (こ.す)
412	proceed	Phó (chạy tới)	赴	proceed, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, magic wand, augury	9	17	In proceeding to a new city or a new job, something in you runs ahead with excitement, and something else holds you back, like a divining rod built into your psyche warning you to check things out carefully before rushing in too wildly.		"Don´t run into trouble, Dumbledore tells Harry. ""Proceed with caution with your wand out.""."	While running, my magic wand tells me where to proceed.	JH	1	フ	おもむ.く	赴く (おもむ.く)
413	surpass	Việt (qua, vượt qua)	越	surpass, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, parade	12	17	"Here we see two parades in competition, each trying to surpass the other by running at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little ""hook"" at the end of the first stroke of the element for parade. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book."		The person in charge of running the parade surpassed all our expectations (by just a extra drop...).	The parade of runners are all trying to SURPASS each other - and they end up running all the way to Vietnam (note that this kanji is also used for the country of Vietnam).	JH	3	エツ、オツ	こ.す、-こ.す、-ご.し、こ.える、-ご.え	越える (こ.える), 越す (こ.す)
414	just so	Thị (ấy thế, lời nói chỉ định.)	是	just so, sun, day, mend	9	17	"In this kanji we are shown someone spending an entire day at mending one stocking, because they want the job done ""just so."" Be sure to make a clear image of a finicky old fusspot to make the abstract idea as concrete as possible."		´Sun´ ´Mend´ - It just so happens that sunshine can mend your gloomy spirits.	My image here is of Fabrice (the guy who runs this website) spending all day obsessively mending the code so this page looks just so....	JH	1	ゼ、シ	これ、この、ここ	
415	topic	Đề	題	topic, just so, sun, day, mend, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	18	17	In many kinds of research, one can find information on a given topic only if the headings are prepared just so.		"The ""TOPIC"" of the day´s newspaper must be placed JUST SO at the top of the PAGE to attract attention."	You spend ALL DAY, mending your socks JUST SO. Then you have a look at the HEADING of the newspaper. The topic---FREE SOCKS TO BE GIVEN AWAY!!!!	3	4	ダイ		
416	dike	Đê	堤	dike, soil, dirt, ground, just so, sun, day, mend	12	17	A dike is a successful bit of engineering only if the amount of earth piled up is measured just so for the height and pressure of the water it is meant to contain.		Making a dike is all about arranging the soil just so....	The little Dutch boy has his finger stuck in the dike, and that´s the only thing keeping his town from going under. He really really needs to go to the bathroom though, so he devises a plan to carefully add a bit of dirt - there, place individual bits in just so - there, I think it´s good enough. Pull it out -----yes! Success!	JH	1	テイ	つつみ	堤 (つつみ)
417	build	Kiến (dựng lên, đặt)	建	build, brush, stretch	9	17	To construct a building, you first draw a set of plans (the writing brush) and then s-t-r-e-t-c-h your drawing out to scale in reality.		Build is easy to remember if you can remember that archtiechts have two steps in building. 1. Take a brush and brush out the blueprints. 2. Get a visual image of the blueprints all rolled up like they usually are. The second step is easy, it´s just the architecht stretching out the blueprints and showing it to his clients.	A construction worker´s classic morning. Stretch, brush his teeth, and then start to build.	4	4	ケン、コン	た.てる、た.て、-だ.て、た.つ	建築 (けんちく), 建議 (けんぎ), 封建的 (ほうけんてき), 建つ (た.つ), 建てる (た.てる)
419	prolong	Duyên (kéo dài)	延	prolong, drop, stop, footprint, stretch	8	17	This character is a kind of pictographic image of how prolonging is a clever way of stopping things by trying to stretch them out a little bit at a time (the extra drop at the top of stop). Be sure to get a concrete image of this process, by imagining yourself prolonging something you can really, physically, stretch.		Stretching correctly prolongs life. Even the top part of 正 is stretching...	"Here´s a great mnemonic: ""stop, drop, and stretch (!?)."" Now let´s associate it with ´prolong´: if you´re ever in an uncomfortable spot, like being asked tricky questions or caught in a lie, just PROLONG the situation - stop, drop, and stretch. They may be confused by your odd behaviour, but it´ll buy you a few moments to think up another good lie to get out of the sticky situation!"	6	2	エン	の.びる、の.べる、の.べ、の.ばす	延ばす (の.ばす), 延びる (の.びる), 延べる (の.べる)
420	nativity	Đản (sinh ra)	誕	nativity, say, words, keitai, mouth, prolonged, drop, stop, footprint, stretch	15	17	The key word of course calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the nativity we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the prolongation of the eternal Word in time and space.		Nativity = born, being born. Think of birth as a painful and prolonged event. And of course, all the words and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her!	When you are being born ( nativity ), your mother´s WORDS are PROLONGED. (Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis huuuuuuuuuuuuuurtss a lottttttttt~!! Owwwwwww!!!).	6	1	タン		
421	cornerstone	Sở (Đá tảng, dùng kê chân cột.)	礎	cornerstone, stone, rock, grove, tree, wood, zoo, critters, tree2, wood2	18	17	"This character depicts a cornerstone as a stone set at the end of a wildlife preserve (the ""zoo in the grove"")."		Features like stones and groves of trees are the cornerstones of a happy zoo.	A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals. At the moment, only the cornerstone has been set in place. To temporarily keep the animals from escaping, a closely-packed grove of small trees is planted around the stone. (Note that this zoo needs some serious mending.).	JH	1	ソ	いしずえ	礎 (いしずえ)
422	bridegroom	Tế (Chàng rể.)	婿	bridegroom, woman, zoo, critters, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	12	17	"What makes a man a bridegroom is obviously a woman and her dowry, here presented as a small zoo (animals were often used for this purpose in earlier societies) and a month away from it all (the ""honeymoon"")."		The virgin bridegroom tries to understand the new, mysterious part of his woman´s body - but with little success. It´s a zoo down there! (primitives placement: the part of the body is ´down there´ - the woman is ´left´ unsatisfied).	The only reason anyone talks about a bridegroom is if they´re about to or have just gotten married. Of course, then you have to go on your honeymoon. So you take your woman to the zoo for a month. Pretty cool honeymoon.	JH	1	セイ	むこ	婿 (むこ)
423	garment	Y	衣	garment, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	6	18	"At the top we see the top hat, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a garment. If you break the ""4-fold"" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember."	"* Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of cloak or scarf will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean cloak. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a scarf. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of garment in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is ""unhooked."""	The garments most commonly associated with the craft of a magician are the top hat and the magic wand. (It´s a stretch, but the way I remembered this kanji is through that phrase. This way you can remember it through using primitives we have already learned.).	The only garments allowed in this club are top hat and scarf.	4	2	イ、エ	ころも、きぬ、-ぎ	衣 (ころも)
424	tailor	Tài (Cắt áo)	裁	tailor, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	12	18	You might think here of garment that have been specially tailored for Thanksgiving celebrations to look like traditional Pilgrim garb.		The tailor was hard at work making sure all the pilgrims were dressed in their best garments for thanksgiving.	The tailor worked hard after thanksgiving to alter garments so they´d fit people who´d eaten too much at their thanksgiving dinners.	6	1	サイ	た.つ、さば.く	裁く (さば.く), 裁つ (た.つ)
425	attire	Trang	装	attire, turtle, samurai, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	12	18	"The character for attire can be remembered as a picture of what we may call a ""turtle-samurai"" sweater. At the top we see the turtle-samurai and at the bottom the element for garment."		The TURTLE SAMURAI needs special GARMENTs for his ATTIRE since his body is much more ROBUST than others.	The ninja turtles tried to go eat at a fancy restaurant, but they were told to come back after their were dressed in proper attire. However, it´s too difficult for them to find proper garments because they bodies are so robust! (sannomiya + drwarrior12).	6	2	ソウ、ショウ	よそお.う、よそお.い	装置 (そうち), 服装 (ふくそう), 変装 (へんそう), 装う (よそお.う)
426	back	Lí (Trong, cái gì ở trong đều gọi là lí.)	裏	back, top hat, scarf, computer	13	18	An innocent looking top hat and scarf lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden computer sewn into the back of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such experiences teach one always to have a look at the back side of things.		The computer had carefully dressed up in clothes to look human. It was n´t until I looked at the back and saw the cables and stuff that I realized what it was.	Can computers be gay? I´m not sure, but mine always wears a top hat and scarf, and for some reason its back door port is always open...	6	2	リ	うら	裏 (うら)
427	demolition	HOẠI	壊	demolition, soil, dirt, ground, poltergeist, BernaE, ten, needle, eye, cross-eyed, net, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	16	18	The right half of this character shows a garment woven so fine that it can pass through the eye of a needle, fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist. In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely demolishes them, razing them to the ground.		If you stand too close to a DEMOLITION site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.	Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing. So, Darth Vader swings his cape (his garment) demolishing a nearby building, leaving nothing but a pile of dirt.	JH	1	カイ、エ	こわ.す、こわ.れる、やぶ.る	壊す (こわ.す), 壊れる (こわ.れる)
428	pathetic	Ai (thương)	哀	pathetic, top hat, scarf, mouth	9	18	A drunken sod in a tattered top hat and soiled silk scarf with a giant mouth guzzling something or other gives us a pathetic character role in which W. C. Fields might find himself right at home.		One of my friends with a crazy sense of fashion loves to wear a tophat and a scarf so that you can´t see his whole face but only his mouth. He thinks it´s cool. I think it´s pathetic.	"A poor, homeless child like Oliver Twist, with a hungry open mouth, is pathetic-- in the original sense of the noun ""pathos."" The tattered tophat and scarf he wears only adds to the pathos."	JH	1	アイ	あわ.れ、あわ.れむ、かな.しい	哀れ (あわ.れ), 哀れむ (あわ.れむ)
429	distant	Viễn (>< cận)	遠	distant, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, scarf, road	13	18	A distant figure on the road is such a blur it looks like a lidded crock wearing a silk scarf.		Keep distant from a lidded crock on the road wrapped in a scarf. It might be a bomb.	When traveling to a distant land, what better way of keeping warm on the road is there than carrying a warm lidded crock and wearing a scarf?	2	3	エン、オン	とお.い	遠近 (えんきん), 永遠 (えいえん), 敬遠 (けいえん), 遠い (とお.い)
430	monkey	Viên (con vượn)	猿	monkey, pack of wild dogs, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, scarf	13	18	This clever little monkey has captured an entire pack of wild dogs, locked them inside a lidded crock, and wrapped the whole thing up in a silk scarf to present to the dogcatcher.		The MONKEY likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easy to see because the SCARF he always wears is at the base of the LIDDED CROCK.	To catch a monkey, chase him with wild dogs into a lidded crock, then tie it with a scarf.	JH	1	エン	さる	猿 (さる)

Brocade is the art of sewing gold on a white towel.	Never heard of this word before encountering it here.

History of the first karate blackbelts: In those days, it was often difficult to find fresh, clean water, so samurai usually had to wash their sashes in stagnant puddles. The longer one had been studying martial arts, the older the sash on one´s karate uniform and, therefore, the darker the color. So why weren´t their karate uniforms black too? Never seen a ninja????	A moat is a stagnate ring of water like an obi (sash) of water tied around the castle.	JH	1	タイ、テイ	とどこお.る	滞る (とどこお.る)

The REVOLVING wheels of the car (with REVOLVER blaring on the stereo) kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust.	Just a note to remember the cloud primative: The name of Goku´s pet cloud that he used to help him rise (fly) in the Dragonball anime series (and also the scientific name for a certain type of cloud) is Nimbus [ http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg ]. The katakana-ization of this is {ニム}バス, so the rising cloud primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style.	3	4	テン	ころ.がる、ころ.げる、ころ.がす、ころ.ぶ、まろ.ぶ、うたた、うつ.る、くる.めく	転がす (ころ.がす), 転がる (ころ.がる), 転げる (ころ.げる), 転ぶ (ころ.ぶ)

451	rain	Vũ	雨	rain, rain, weather	8	18	This kanji, also a primitive, is one of the clearest instances we have of a complex pictograph. The top line is the sky, the next 3 strokes a pair of clouds, and the final 4 dots the rain collected there and waiting to fall.	* As a primitive it can mean either rain or weather in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown.	From the ceiling hangs a towel dripping four drops like RAIN.	Towel hung out on a line to ....oops, it´s rain.	1	5	ウ	あめ、あま-、-さめ	雨 (あま), 雨 (あめ)
452	cloud	Vân (mây)	雲	cloud, rain, weather, rising cloud, two, elbow, wall	12	18	Here is the full character for cloud from which the primitive for a rising cloud derives. Clouds begin with vapors rising up in small clouds from the surface of the earth, and then gathering to make clouds that eventually dump their rain back on the earth.

455	frost	Sương	霜	frost, rain, weather, inter, Inter Milan, tree, wood, eye	17	18	Think of frost as a cooperative venture, an inter-action of the malevolent forces of weather that sit around a conference table and finally decide to allow a very light amount of moisture to fall just before a short and sudden freeze.		FROST is kind of an inter-weather, phenomenon, something between rain, snow and freezing temp’s.	The freezing RAIN formed FROST on the TREE right before your EYES. If you want, frost-y then think Frost Tree to get to the mnemonic. SECOND STORY: FROSTY the snowman? It´s RAIN that FROSTS that can then INTER-act with the kids, till he melts of course.

456	winter	Đông	冬	winter, walking legs, ice	5	18	Walking legs slipping on the ice are a sure sign of winter.		Don´t slip off your legs in winter, strap two skis to your feet.	In winter my walking legs feel like blocks of ice.	2	4	トウ	ふゆ	冬 (ふゆ)
457	heavens	Thiên (Nhà tôn giáo gọi chỗ các thần linh ở là thiên)	天	heavens, heavens, one, ceiling, large	4	18	This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the Heavens. (You may, of course, use the elements ceiling and St. Bernard instead.)	* The primitive can mean either the heaven of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the heavens. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (Frame 40), rather than left to right. From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a witch.	If you think of the sky as a ceiling above our heads, here you have the heavens as the largest ceiling you could ever imagine. As Heisig pointed out, nothing comes above the ceiling primitive thus the order of primitives is taken care of.	The ceiling that all large dogs aspire to go to is known as heaven. After all, All Dogs Go to Heaven.	1	5	テン	あまつ、あめ、あま-	天 (あめ)
460	bridge	Kiều (cái cầu)	橋	bridge, tree, wood, angel, heavens, mouth, hood, mouth, mouth2	16	18	"The bridge shown here is made of trees in their natural form, except that the trunks have been carved into the forms of angels, a sort of ""Ponte degli Angeli."""

Her family tells her, ""Don´t worry, your mom is an angel now, in heaven, watching over you."" The small girl takes this very literally and is found one day, gathering pieces of wood.

462	stand up	Lập (Gây dựng)	立	stand up, vase, stand up	5	18	This picture of a vase standing up has its meaning extended to represent the general posture of anything standing up.	* Used as a primitive, it can also mean vase. Using its kanji meaning, think of something standing up that is normally lying down, or something standing up in an unusual way.	A vase that can´t stand up won´t be a vase for long.	He was a stand up guy: he´d lend you the top hat he wears everyday if you asked, and he will turn everything upside down to help you find your tools.	1	4	リツ、リュウ、リットル	た.つ、-た.つ、た.ち-、た.てる、-た.てる、た.て-、たて-、-た.て、-だ.て、-だ.てる	立案 (りつあん), 起立 (きりつ), 独立 (どくりつ), 立つ (た.つ), 立てる (た.てる)

In the military, badges are given out early in the day, with everyone standing at attention.	"Ash Ketchum stood up early in the morning, and said, ""Pikachu, let´s go get us another badge!""."	3	2	ショウ		
465	vie	Cạnh (ganh)	競	vie, vase, stand up, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs, vase2, stand up2, elder brother2, teenager2, mouth2, human legs2	20	18	Two teenagers are seen here standing up to one another, vying for the attention of their peers.		TWO twin BROTHERS are competing (VYING) for the title of who is the older BROTHER. The game is that they must balance a VASE on their head and the one who drops his looses and becomes the younger BROTHER!

466	sovereign	Đế (vua)	帝	sovereign, vase, stand up, apron, crown, towel	9	18	An uncommon, but not altogether unlikely picture of a reigning sovereign has him standing up in his apron, presumably at the behest of HIS sovereign (she who is to be obeyed), who needs help with washing the dishes.		The crazy sovereign stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That´s why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.	"This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the standing element takes those little crown ""winglets"" on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She´s standing on her crown rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her apron. I guess the sovereign´s servants have the day off."	JH	1	テイ	みかど	
468	juvenile	Đồng (trẻ thơ)	童	juvenile, vase, stand up, computer	12	18	This frame shows up the image of a juvenile hacker standing on top of a computer, or rather jumping up and down on it, because it refused to come up with the right answer.		The juvenile stood on top of his computer and broke it. Noob.	The movie Zoolander is a little JUVENILE and silly, but I love it nonetheless. Just remember Owen Wilson standing on the desk, hitting the computer like a monkey. (The files are IN the computer - IN the computer...).	3	2	ドウ	わらべ	童 (わらべ)
469	pupil	Đồng (Lòng tử, con ngươi.)	瞳	pupil, eye, juvenile, vase, stand up, computer	17	18	"Begin with the double meaning of the key word pupil: ""student"" and the ""the apple of one's eye."" Now all you have to do is dwell on the phrase ""juvenile of one's eye"" (the meaning here) until it provides you with an image."		In Japanese comics, the eye´s of juvenilles all have enormouse pupils.	WARNING: This kanji only means the pupil of the eye. It can be confusing to use a story that has pupil meaning student in it.

471	make a deal	Thương	商	make a deal, vase, stand up, alien, hood, human legs, mouth	11	18	See the peddlar standing atop his motorcycle helmet as if it were a soapbox, hawking his wares to passersby. The legs and mouth represent the tools of the trade of making a deal any way you can.		I use what I think is the real etymology for this kanji which is so shocking it sticks. The STANDING member at the top is a certain part of the body that all men have and it is approaching the HOLE between TWO LEGS (the HOOD) with extra marks to show they are FLESHY - ie a womans legs. So this shows the oldest DEAL of all time - prostitution.	"Slick Willy standing on the motorcycle helmet he´s trying to sell you to demonstrate how rugged it is. His legs crash through the top of it and after a moment of awkward silence his mouth opens and says, ""hey, we can still make a deal.""."	3	3	ショウ	あきな.う	商う (あきな.う)
472	legitimate wife	Đích (vợ cả)	嫡	legitimate wife, woman, antique, vase, stand up, hood, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	14	18	"The phrase legitimate wife would have no meaning if there were not such things as ""illegitimate wives,"" taken because one's legal woman has turned into an antique. The very offense of the idea should help you remember the kanji."		Legitmate wifes tend to be women who are antiques in contrast to the young bit of illigitmate fluff on the side.	Your legitimate wife is like an antique bong. Its not your favorite but you still hit it sometimes...	JH	1	チャク、テキ		
473	suitable	Thích	適	suitable, antique, vase, stand up, hood, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth, road	14	18	Can you imagine anything less suitable to do with one's precious antiques than to display them in the middle of a crowded road-way?		"Think of the term from televison ""suitable for all audiences"" to get the sense of the word. What program could be more suitable for the whole family than the ""antiques road(show)""."	That old thing in your attic might be suitable to be shown on the Antiques Roadshow.	5	3	テキ	かな.う

476	spoon	Chuỷ	匕	spoon, sitting on the ground	2	18	This character, a pictograph of a spoon, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for seven, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second.	* As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone sitting on the ground, of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly.	To remember the primitive meaning, picture someone sitting on the ground performing Seppuku...with a spoon. http://tinyurl.com/co48k.	Not only is stroke order important, but also be sure to note the direction of a stroke. In both ´spoon´ and ´seven´, the first stroke is the horizontal one - but here it is written right to left in a downward flick, while in ´seven´ it is a strong line from left to right.			ヒ	さじ、さじのひ	
480	north	Bắc	北	north, spoon, sitting on the ground	5	18	The cold air from the north is so strong that we see two people sitting on the ground back to back, their arms interlocked so they don't blow away. (Pay special attention to the drawing of the first 3 strokes.)		Warning: The left part is NOT the primitive turtle! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference!	In the north, the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.	2	5	ホク	きた	北 (きた)
481	stature	Bối (vai)	背	stature, north, spoon, sitting on the ground, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	9	18	"One's stature is measured according to the ""northern-most"" part of the body."		While japanese people are generally small, people in the northern contryes have taller stature because of all the flesh they eat!	Up in the Great White North, we eat a lot of meat - thus giving us great STATURE. Mmmm.... baby seals.	6	3	ハイ	せ、せい、そむ.く、そむ.ける	背 (せ), 背 (せい), 背く (そむ.く), 背ける (そむ.ける)

483	descendants	Côn	昆	descendants, sun, day, compare, spoon, sitting on the ground, spoon2, sitting on the ground2	8	18	"By comparing apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have descended from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything descended from everything else, one way or another, means that there is ""nothing new UNDER the sun."""

If you compare colors, you will find that white is produced from the mix of all the others.	Sometimes, Dr. Heisig´s keyword choices are really quite bizarre.

Every chef will tell you, fat is what make the meat taste delicious.	Fat is the most delicious part of the flesh. (Note this refers to physical fat, not the concept of obesity obese (#494)).	JH	2	シ	あぶら	脂 (あぶら)
496	I (one)	NHẤT	壱	1 (one), samurai, crown, spoon, sitting on the ground	7	18	"The Roman numeral I - like that for II we met earlier in frame 379 - is only rarely used now. In the midst of all the samurai, we notice one in particular sitting on the ground with a crown on his head, indicating that he is ""number I"" in the current rankings."		I am ´the one´ , says the samurai with the crown around his waist and a spoon up his a***.	The samurai who has been crowned number one is so good he uses a spoon to fight with rather than a sword.

499	plum	MAI (quả mận)	梅	plum, tree, wood, every, reclining, lying down, mother, breasts	10	18	Behind every Jack Horner's pie maker, a tree full of plums.		Plums actually grow on every single tree. What, you didn´t know that? They do. Orange trees, apple trees, cantaloupe trees. Plums are simply mutant fruits that have been installed in the root software of every single tree. I hear that some plum-loving scientists are working on a way to hack every tree´s genetic code so that every tree will bear nothing _but_ plums.	EVERY Japanese person asks you if you like UMEBOSHI. No I say, I prefer to eat my PLUMS fresh from the TREE.	4	1	バイ	うめ	梅 (うめ)

Every drop of water will eventually return to the sea.	As depicted in the classic SF film Fantastic Voyage, every drop of water is a sea, if you look close enough.

Here we see the victims begging for just a little mist for relief.		During a drought, everything begs for even a mist for relief.	Beggar has to drink mist because there is no water in the drought. I get this one confused with thirst 451 but try to remember that there is no water element beacuse it is a drought.	JH	2	カン、ケン	かわ.く、かわ.かす、ほ.す、ひ.る、いぬい	乾かす (かわ.かす), 乾く (かわ.く)

504	duplicate	PHỨC	複	duplicate, cloak, fold back, double back, reclining, lying down, sun, day, walking legs	14	18	In its original and etymologically transparent sense, to duplicate something means to double it back with a fold, like the fold of a cloak.		My girlfiend saw someone wearing the exact same (duplicate) outfit at a party, so she doubled back to change!	"In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione uses a device called a ""time-turner"" to double back in time, but this creates duplicates. The smart thing to do would be to combine Hermione´s time-turner with Harry´s invisibility cloak. That way, one could double back in time without creating any visible duplicates."	5	2	フク		
505	lack	KHIẾM	欠	lack, yawn	4	18	The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a lack of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see.	* As a primitive, it can mean either yawn or lack.	To me, this kanji looks like a person with two arms and two legs, but who lacks a head.	When your body lacks oxygen you yawn.	4	3	ケツ、ケン	か.ける、か.く、あくび	欠く (か.く), 欠ける (か.ける)
506	blow	XUY (thổi)	吹	blow, mouth, lack, yawn	7	18	To blow is really no more than a deliberate effort to make one's mouth lack all the air that is in it.		This is clearly a BLOWJOB, we can see the MOUTH and the LACK OF condom. (I am sorry for the image, but it sticks forever in your mind).	I keep confusing this with suck (#689).

507	cook	XUY	炊	cook, fire, lack, yawn	8	18	Better to picture what happens when you do not pay attention to your work in the kitchen. Here we see a blazing fire and an inattentive, yawning cook who let things get out of control.		Japanese cooking sometimes lacks fire, e.g., sashimi.

JH	1	スイ	た.く、-だ.き	炊く (た.く)
508	song	CA	歌	song, cancan, can, mouth, street, nail, spike, lack, yawn, can2, mouth2, street2, nail2, spike2	14	18	The song in this kanji is being sung by a chorus line of can-can girls. Why it should be eliciting nothing but yawning from the audience, I leave to you to decide.		Can-Can-ers lack the ability to sing a song, so they just dance.	Can-can dancers are supposed to be big-bosomed girls who dance. Yet these so called can-can dancers are flat-chested and singing a song, so audience of men is yawning in boredom.	2	4	カ	うた、うた.う	歌 (うた), 歌う (うた.う)
509	soft	NHUYỄN	軟	soft, car, lack, yawn	11	18	If the cushions of one's car are too soft, one may begin yawning at the wheel.		Cars are rough steel things, lacking softness.

JH	2	ナン	やわ.らか、やわ.らかい	軟らか (やわ.らか), 軟らかい (やわ.らかい)
510	next	THỨ	次	next, ice, lack, yawn	6	18	"This key word connotes the ""next in line"" of a succession of people or things. Let there be a lack of ice on the hottest day of summer, and you stand impatiently in line waiting for the distributor to call out ""Next!"""	* As a primitive, this character can either retain its key word meaning of next or the related meaning of second.	Is this store lacking ice? Let´s try the next one, then.	"A rapper called ""Ice"" went for auditions but was told he lacked talent. Next..."	3	3	ジ、シ	つ.ぐ、つぎ	次回 (じかい), 次元 (じげん), 目次 (もくじ), 次ぐ (つ.ぐ), 次 (つぎ)
511	briar	TỲ (Cỏ tật lê, thứ cỏ có gai.)	茨	briar, flowers, next, ice, lack, yawn	9	18	"Earlier we made mention of the story of Briar Rose (or ""Sleeping Beauty,"" as we called her in frame 165) and drew attention to the briar hedge that grew up all about her castle. But in the second part of the story, these briars blossomed into flowers. Hence her name, Briar Rose. Be careful not to confuse this character with that for thorn (Frame 446)."		To prevent animals from eating the beautiful flowers in your garden, the best thing to do is to plant briar bushes immediately next to them.	The briar patch may look unremarkable now before it blooms, but there will be flowers next, and it will be beautiful.	JH		シ、ジ	いばら、かや、くさぶき	茨 (いばら)
512	assets	TƯ	資	assets, next, ice, lack, yawn, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	13	18	The first shells (money) you earn, you use to pay your debts. From then on, the next shells you accumulate become your assets.		Assets are the next best thing to money.	The first SHELLS you get you obviously spend, but the NEXT SHELLS are your ASSETS, you should bury them in a low safe place (placement!).	5	3	シ		
513	figure	TƯ (Dáng dấp thùy mị. Cho nên gọi dáng điệu con gái là tư sắc)	姿	figure, next, ice, lack, yawn, woman	9	18	This kanji depicts a woman's figure as a sort of second self.		The next woman always has a better figure! Thinking like that, you´ll end up alone in an old folks home longing for the good old days!	Whenever I am next to a woman, I can´t help but take notice of her figure.	6	1	シ	すがた	姿 (すがた)
514	consult with	TY (Mưu, hỏi.)	諮	consult with, say, words, keitai, mouth, next, ice, lack, yawn, mouth, mouth2	16	18	To seek the words of a second mouth is to consult with someone about something.		Having a word with the next mouth over, like a neighbor, is usually a good way to consult with somebody for cheap. Because, you know, actual consultants charge huge sums.	Consulting with is having words with the next mouth.	JH	1	シ	はか.る	諮る (はか.る)
515	compensation	Bồi	賠	compensation, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, muzzle, vase, stand up, mouth	15	19	Picture a clam used as a muzzle to quiet the complaints of a fisherman's widow asking compensation for her husband lost at sea.		Compensation is money you give to someone to shut them up (i.e. muzzle their mouth).	Compensation is a kind of euphemism for hush money here. Money that muzzles.	JH	1	バイ		
516	cultivate	BỒI	培	cultivate, soil, dirt, ground, muzzle, vase, stand up, mouth	11	19	The barrel hoops used by many Japanese farmers to stretch clear plastic over row of vegetables in a garden patch in the hopes of cultivating bigger and bigger vegetables is a way of muzzling the soil.		To cultivate the land is to tame it, control it. In short, you muzzle it´s unruly, chaotic nature.	The illegal immigrants cultivate the land but are socially and politically muzzled (wear muzzles while they work too).	JH	1	バイ	つちか.う	培う (つちか.う)
517	divide	PHẪU	剖	divide, muzzle, vase, stand up, mouth, sword, sabre, saber	10	19	"To ""divide and conquer"" you use a saber and a muzzle."		When you DIVIDE someone, there is sure to be a lot of screaming. That´s why you should use a MUZZLE before using the SABER.	Divide and conquer - first you cut them up (saber) , then you shut them up (muzzle).	JH	1	ボウ		
518	sound	ÂM	音	sound, vase, stand up, sun, day, tongue wagging	9	19	The kanji for sound depicts something standing in the air over a tongue wagging in a mouth, much the same as a sound does for the briefest of moments before disappearing.	* The primitive from this kanji also means simply a sound.	If you were standing on the sun, believe me, you´d be making sound.	The tongue wagging in a mouth produces a very high-pitched sound, breaking a nearby vase.	1	4	オン、イン、ノン	おと、ね	音楽 (おんがく), 発音 (はつおん), 騒音 (そうおん), 音 (おと), 音 (ね)
519	darkness	ÁM	暗	darkness, sun, day, sound, vase, stand up, sun, day, sun2, day2	13	19	"When ""darkness covered the earth"" at the beginning of time, there was neither sun nor sound."		Picture the sun exploding - there would be a gigantic noise and then...nothing. Everything would plunge into darkness.	"In places of complete darkness, such as caves where the sun can´t reach, creatures such as bats have learned to navigate by sound rather than sight. The poor guys must have to fly around screaming ""Marco!"" and ""Polo!"" all the time."	3	3	アン	くら.い、くら.む、くれ.る	暗い (くら.い)
520	rhyme	VẦN	韻	rhyme, sound, vase, stand up, sun, day, employee, mouth, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	19	19	"Poetry restricted to verses that rhyme often finds it has to abandon clarity of thought in order to make the rhyme of the words work. In this kanji's picture, one becomes a kind of ""sound-employee."""		What is a RHYME but some SOUND that EMPLOYEES say to get them through work.	"Dr Seuss´s employee finally rebels against him: ""I´m tired of odd sounds all the time, I will not, cannot, speak in RHYME!""."	JH	1	イン

Words are difficult to discriminate/discern from sounds in the middle of a fiesta.	I have discriminating taste. I´d rather listen to the words of a lecture than attend a kazoo concert. (Picture some snobby guy in a tweed jacket turning up his nose at entering a loud raucous kazoo recital).	5	3	シキ	し.る、しる.す	
522	mirror	KÍNH	鏡	mirror, metal, gold, mirror, vase, stand up, sun, day, human legs	19	19	After lakes but before glass, polished metal was used for mirrors. These metal mirrors are recalled in this character for a mirror.		Mirror should suggest vanity.

In the dense cities of Japan even a small garden is a luxury. In this house, the owner has put mirrors on the boundary of his land so it feels much bigger.	This is an old trick to keep out migrants. You put a bunch of dirty mirrors on the boundary of your land and theirs. When they approach the boundary, what they see in the mirror is their own land and someone that looks like themselves, only dirtier, so they figure your country isn´t any better than their own and they head back home.	5	2	キョウ、ケイ	さかい	境界 (きょうかい), 境地 (きょうち), 逆境 (ぎゃっきょう), 境 (さかい)
524	deceased	VONG	亡	deceased, perish, top hat, fishhook	3	19	A top hat hanging on a hook in the front hall, right where the deceased left it the day he died, reminds us of him and his kanji.	* In addition to deceased, the primitive meaning of to perish will also be used for this character.	The top hat hanging on a hook belonged to the now deceased Charlie Chaplin.

If you think you should perish for that woman, you have a major delusion.	JH	1	モウ、ボウ	みだ.りに	妄信 (もうしん), 妄想 (もうそう), 迷妄 (めいもう)
527	laid waste	Hoang (hoang dã, hoang dại)	荒	laid waste, wreath, flowers, deceased, perish, top hat, fishhook, stream, flood	9	19	The flowers that perish in the flood are taken here as symbols of an area that has been laid waste.		After Godzilla laid waste to the city, the survivors put some flowers on the bodies of the deceased and floated their bodies down the stream.	"Laying waste is just a euphamism for flushing poop down the toilet. It smells nothing like flowers, more like deceased flowers, and it´s flushed down into a stream of sewage.

The ambitions of kings often result in dead bodies.	4	3	ボウ、モウ	のぞ.む、もち	望郷 (ぼうきょう), 希望 (きぼう), 人望 (じんぼう), 望む (のぞ.む)
529	direction	PHƯƠNG	方	direction, compass, direction	4	19	Spinning a dagger about on its hilt on the top of a top hat - waiting to see in which direction it points when it comes to rest - one leaves to fate where one is going next. Take care in writing this character.	* As a primitive, this character will take the sense of a compass, the instrument used to determine direction.	Note: The primitives are top hat and bound up. Compare ten thousand (#64). Story: A rich man wearing a top hat and bound up from head to toe hobbles up to you and asks for directions to the nearest police station because he just escaped from his kidnappers.	I always keep my directions bound to the bottom of my top hat so I won´t lose them.	2	4	ホウ	かた、-かた、-がた	方 (かた)

She used a perfume so strong, that you can track her by following the direction of the smell of flowers.	People always seem to overdo it with their perfume. It seems that whenever I am at school, somebody walks by with their cheap flowery perfume. If I close my eyes, I can actually use that floweriness as a compass - it tells me which direction they´re in.	JH	1	ホウ	かんば.しい	芳しい (かんば.しい)
533	obese	PHƯƠNG (béo)	肪	obese, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, compass, direction	8	19	If you eat too much, you may need a compass to find your way around the obese mass of flesh that piles up in the midsection. Compare this with your stories for round (Frame 44) and fat (Frame 494), similar in meaning but distinct in imagery.		Flesh in all directions = obese.	Yo momma so obese, she changed the direction of the moon.	JH	1	ボウ

541	increase	Tăng (thêm, tăng tốc..)	増	increase, soil, dirt, ground, increase, formerly, horns, rice field, brains, sun, day	14	19	This kanji depicts an increase of soil, multiplying so fast that it literally buries everything in its path.		Để TĂNG phần kịch tính thì bạn hết tiền (cạp đất mà ăn) và còn bị TẰNG (cắm sừng) :)) Prices always INCREASE for LAND that was FORMERLY cheaper.	Farmers work the land so they can INCREASE their formerly puny crop supply.	5	3	ゾウ	ま.す、ま.し、ふ.える、ふ.やす	増える (ふ.える), 増やす (ふ.やす), 増す (ま.す)
542	presents	Tặng	贈	presents, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, increase, formerly, horns, rice field, brains, sun, day	18	19	"The presents offered here are money that increases each time you give it away. Do not confuse with the temporal word ""present"" (Frame 275)."		Presents represent money that was formerly yours.	Imagine if the number of presents you get increases with each birthday. So on your first birthday, you receive just one shell as a present, but the next year it increases to two shells as presents, and so on, increasing and increasing so by the time you´re elderly, the number of shells you´ll get as presents will have increased to an awful lot of presents. GOT IT YET? PRESENTS = SHELLS + INCREASE.	JH	2	ゾウ、ソウ	おく.る	贈与 (ぞうよ), 贈呈 (ぞうてい), 贈答 (ぞうとう), 贈る (おく.る)
543	east	Đông	東	east, sun, day, tree, wood	8	19	"As a ""Western"" language, English identifies the east with the rising sun. In more fanciful terms, we see the sun piercing through a tree as it rises in the east."	"* Both the direction east and the part of the world called ""the East"" are primitive meanings of this character."	Traditionally seen as a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree.

544	ridgepole	Đống (toà nhà, nóc mái nhà)	棟	ridgepole, tree, wood, east, tree, wood, sun, day, tree2, wood2	12	19	If the piece of wood in the roof known as the ridgepole points east, the sunrise will be visible from the front door.		Feng Shui states that the ridgepole of a house should be made of wood and face east.	Ok just a note to the ´ridgepole facing east story´ im making up a story to JUSTIFY why that is the case. Assuming that 99% of you guys use the age old story of a ´sun rising through a tree tells you were the east is´, back in those days when people used ridgepoles they wanted to align their houses in such a way that they face the rising sun, so they wake up with a bright day, and wake up early with the sun seeping through in a perpendicular manner( as the ridge pole faces the sun in the morning).	JH	1	トウ	むね、むな-	棟 (むね)
545	frozen	Đông (đông lạnh)	凍	frozen, ice, east, tree, wood, sun, day	10	19	"The whole secret to breaking the ice with the East is to peek behind those mysteriously ""frozen smiles."""		Eastern Siberia is often frozen by ice. According to wikipedia, Yakutia (in Eastern Siberia) holds the record as the coldest town on Earth. Check it out yourself...it made it stick for me!	The ice will stay frozen until the sun is visible through the trees.	JH	2	トウ	こお.る、こご.える、こご.る、い.てる、し.みる	凍る (こお.る), 凍える (こご.える)
546	pregnancy	Nhâm (mang thai)	妊	pregnancy, woman, porter, drop, samurai	7	19	A woman who is in her pregnancy is a bit like a porter, bearing her new companion wherever she goes.		A pregnant woman is a porter of her child.	The gentleman gave the woman a bit of sperm...BAM PREGNANCY!	JH	1	ニン、ジン	はら.む、みごも.る	
547	courts	Đình (pháp đình, triều đình)	廷	courts, porter, drop, samurai, stretch	7	19	Those who rule the courts, the porters of justice and order, are often found to stretch the law to suit their own purposes. Recall the kanji for prolong from frame 419 and keep it distinct.		A porter has run away from his master. His punishment is to be stretched out on the rack. So say the courts in this barbaric time.	The gentleman stretched the truth a bit in court.	JH	1	テイ		
548	dye	Nhiễm (ô nhiễm, nhuộm)	染	dye, water, water droplets, water pistol, nine, baseball, tree, wood	9	20	Water . . . nine . . . tree. From those elements you must compose a plot for the key word, dye. Here, as elsewhere, any of the alternate meanings of the primitives may be used, provided they do not require a position other than that of the kanji in question.		To make this dye, I used water and the barks of nine different trees.	The baseball team hangs their freshly dyed dripping jerseys at the top of a tree to dry.	6	1	セン	そ.める、-ぞ.め、-ぞめ、そ.まる、し.みる、-じ.みる、し.み、-し.める	染み (し.み), 染みる (し.みる), 染まる (そ.まる), 染める (そ.める)

Beware of letting the simple reading off of the primitive elements do your work for you. Unless you make a vivid image of something burning and relate it just as vividly to those primitive meanings, you can count on forgetting this character very quickly.		Any sort of thing can burn in the fire.	"Somebody from PETA is really angry that they sell dog meat in China, so they´ve gone to burn down the whole cart (my mnemonic for ""sort of thing"" was seeing strips of dog flesh roasting, and saying ""well, that´s just the sort of thing they do here in China)."	5	2	ネン	も.える、も.やす、も.す	燃える (も.える), 燃す (も.す), 燃やす (も.やす)

The elements are: house . . . ceiling . . . few . . . shells.		This house is reserved to V.I.P. only. If you are not one of the few with enough money to call you that way, keep out!	The V.I.P. visits your house, but your ceiling is too low for his inflated head, which he bumps and hurts. You have to give him your few shells as compensation.	JH	1	ヒン

Santa had to put his foot down to stop a march of little guys, namely elves. They were protesting the harsh treatment they get every year-end when Santa asks them to step up toy production for the holiday season.	At the year-end, everything seems to come to a stop. However, there´s still enough time for a little march to celebrate.	JH	3	サイ、セイ	とし、とせ、よわい	歳末 (さいまつ), 歳月 (さいげつ), 二十歳 (はたち)
552	prefecture	Huyện	県	prefecture, eye, fishhook, small, little	9	20	Above, an eye and a fishhook, and below the primitive for little. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down (eye of a needle into eye and fishhook) if you think it helps.		In Japanese this is KEN, as in Barbie´s boyfriend. He has lovely blue eyes, a girlfriend who is as thin as a straightened out fish hook. But, down where it counts, he has very little to show...	After sticking a fishhook in your eye, the yakuza boss probably has little more to do to convince you to move to a different prefecture.	3	2	ケン	か.ける	
553	horse chestnut	Dẻ (một loại hạt dẻ)	栃	horse chestnut, tree, wood, Wimbledon, cliff, ten thousand, one, bound up	9	20	A tree . . . cliff . . . ten thousand.		There are a bunch of HORSE CHESTNUT TREES on top of this CLIFF above the beach. Chestnuts keep rolling off the cliff and falling on people´s heads. So far TEN THOUSAND people have been killed by falling chestnuts, and the Japanese government still ain´t did shit about it.	There is a horse chestnut tree that has grown by a cliff for so long, it has deposited 10,000 horse chesnuts that lie at the bottom. Don´t worry over this one too much, you´ll spend so much time trying to figure out the right story for it, you probably won´t forget it.	JH			とち	栃 (とち)
554	ground	Địa (đất: thổ địa, địa đạo)	地	ground, soil, dirt, ground, scorpion	6	21	"Soil and a scorpion (an ""earth animal""). This is, of course, the full character from which the primitive for ground derives."		Picture the ground as an extent of soil where scorpions are buried like land mines. Imagine a sign post saying ´no trespassing, scorpion mines´ if that helps, and how it is dangerous to walk there.	The soil is littered with scorpions everywhere and no ones dares put their foot on the ground.	2	4	チ、ジ		地下 (ちか), 天地 (てんち), 境地 (きょうち)
555	pond	Trì (cái ao)	池	pond, water, water droplets, water pistol, scorpion	6	21	"Water . . . scorpion. It would be easy to slip into a ""lazy image"" in cases like this one, picturing, let us say, a scorpion near the water. But if you picture rather a scorpion letting its venom out drop by drop until it has made a whole pond of the stuff, the image is more likely to remain fixed."		Remember the story of the scorpion that begged the turtle for a ride across the pond? Halfway across the water, the scorpion stung the turtle on the neck and they both sank to the bottom.	Water scorpions loves to live in the pond.	2	2	チ	いけ	池 (いけ)
556	insect	Trùng (côn trùng)	虫	insect, in, stick, mouth	6	21	Work with the pictograph as you wish.	* As a primitive, this insect will refer to the whole insect kingdom; it can be further specified for each kanji that contains it.	I see the bottom of this kanji as an arm, and the top is an insect biting into the arm, sucking some blood.	Insect in one drop of amber. Think Jurassic Park.	1	2	チュウ、キ	むし	虫 (むし)
557	lightning bug	Huỳnh (đom đóm, huỳnh quang)	蛍	lightning-bug, schoolhouse, owl, crown, insect	11	21	Schoolhouse . . . insect.		Bugs have to go to school to learn how to become lightning bugs. Only the brightest bugs graduate to become lightning bugs.	Q: Who´s the smartest insect in school? A: The lightning-bug. Because he´s so bright! (Image: lightning bug in school with glasses, pocket protector, etc. Maybe even have some cool kids teasing him).	JH	1	ケイ	ほたる	蛍 (ほたる)
558	snake	Xà (con rắn)	蛇	snake, insect, wind chimes, house, spoon, sitting on the ground	11	21	Insect . . . house . . . spoon.		A snake eats insects and he does that outside, while we eat another snake in the house and preferably with a spoon.	Solid Snake crawled like a bug, infiltrated my house, and took out everyone with a spoon.	JH	1	ジャ、ダ、イ、ヤ	へび	蛇の目 (へびのめ), 蛇腹 (じゃばら), 大蛇 (おろち), 蛇 (へび)
559	rainbow	Hồng	虹	rainbow, insect, craft	9	21	Insect . . . craft.		Little is it known that a rainbow is actually created by insects of different colours flying in formation, a craft they have perfected to create the rainbows we see today.	Rainbow is of course created by billions of colored insects (what? you really thought it was an optical illusion?). However I had problems remembering that the insect primitive goes on the left. If you have similar difficulties, try this: rainbow is an Insect-Craft. Mnemonic: I.C. Rainbow (I see rainbow).	JH	1	コウ	にじ	虹 (にじ)
560	butterfly	Điệp (con bướm)	蝶	butterfly, insect, Tarzan, generation, tree, wood	15	21	Insect . . . generation . . . tree.		A butterfly is an insect that appears after spending a generation on a tree as a cocoon.	Butterflies are insects that like to eat just the flowers but leave the leaves behind. (helps me to think of the kanji for leaves, minus the flower bit).	Names	1	チョウ		
561	single	Độc (cô độc, đơn độc)	独	single, pack of wild dogs, insect	9	21	Think of this key word in connection with bachelorhood. The elements: wild dogs . . . insect.		The bachelor´s apartment looked like it had been attacked by a pack of wild dogs. There were even insects in the kitchen. No wonder he´s single!	A SINGLE guy is a WILD DOG who BUGS many women.	5	1	ドク、トク	ひと.り	独り (ひと.り)
562	silkworm	Tằm	蚕	silkworm, heavens, insect	10	21	Heavens . . . insect. Be sure to do something about the position of the two elements.		There are no insects in heaven - well, that is, except for silkworms. What, do you expect Jesus to import his fancy robes from China?	In China it was believed that the silkworms were insects sent from heaven because of the beautiful material they produced.	6	1	サン、テン	かいこ、こ	蚕 (かいこ)
563	wind	Phong (phong ba, phong cách, phong tục)	風	wind, gnats, drop, insect	9	21	Windy . . . drops of . . . insects. Hint: think of the last two primitives as representing a swarm of gnats, those tiny drops of pesky insects.		They say that when an INSECT flaps its wings even the single DROP of WIND that it creates is sometimes enough to create a hurricane on the other side of the Earth.	The WIND usually carries things around in it - drops of rain or snow, and lots of insects.	2	4	フウ、フ	かぜ、かざ-、-かぜ	風力 (ふうりょく), 風俗 (ふうぞく), 強風 (きょうふう), 風 (かぜ)
564	self	Kỷ (tự kỉ, vị kỉ (chỉ vì mình))	己	self, snake, self	3	21	The kanji carries the abstract sense of the self, the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a snake - which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar keywords, oneself (frame 36) and I (frame 17).	* As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the snake - of which it is a pictograph - or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the snake has in myth and fable.	"This kanji looks like the ""s"" of ""self"", looking at its own reflection in a mirror (reversed sideways), as if pondering about his ""self""."	When Superman looks at himself in the mirror, this is what he sees on his chest.	6	1	コ、キ	おのれ、つちのと、な	自己 (じこ), 利己 (りこ), 己 (おのれ)
565	rouse	Khởi (khởi động, khởi nghĩa)	起	rouse, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, snake, self	10	21	Run . . . snake.		Be careful when you´re RUNNING through the jungle, because you might step on and ROUSE a sleeping SNAKE. Then you´ll have to RUN like hell before it bites you!	Nothing will rouse you quite as much as finding a snake in your bed. You will run away like you´ve never run before!	3	4	キ	お.きる、お.こる、お.こす、おこ.す、た.つ	起きる (お.きる), 起こす (お.こす), 起こる (お.こる)
566	queen	Phi (phi tần (vợ lẽ cùa vua))	妃	queen, woman, snake, self	6	21	Woman . . . snake.		Cleopatra.	Be careful you don´t pick up a drag queen at a club - they might look like women, but they have a snake down there!	JH	1	ヒ	きさき	
567	reformation	Cải (cải cách)	改	reformation, snake, self, taskmaster	7	21	Pluralizing the snake and focusing on a single taskmaster may help recommend the image of Ireland's most famous reformer, St. Patrick, who, legend has it, drove away the snakes from the land.		The taskmaster of Slytherin ( wizardry house symbolized by a snake ) plans a reformation of Hogwarts, disallowing the study of magic to all muggle-born. こわいですね！.	This is a Meiji reformation taskmaster, trying to force usage of the Roman alphabet in Japan in place of Kanji. He holds a snake in the shape of the letter S and tries to explain how much simpler this is (j/k).	4	2	カイ	あらた.める、あらた.まる	改まる (あらた.まる), 改める (あらた.める)
568	scribe	Kí (thư kí, kí sự, kí ức)	記	scribe, say, words, keitai, mouth, snake, self	10	21	Words . . . snake.		A scribe writes down the words spoken by a snake (i.e. a lawyer).	Snakes have no hands. So, when a snake needs to write down something, it has to call in a SCRIBE, who will write down all the sayings of the snake.	2	3	キ	しる.す	記す (しる.す)
569	wrap	Bao (bao bọc)	包	wrap, bound up, snake, self	5	21	Bind up . . . snake.	"* The primitive meaning of wrap should always be used with the snake in mind to avoid confusion with similar terms. Just let ""wrap"" mean ""with a snake coiled about it."""	The snake bound up its prey by wrapping his body around it.	Imagine Jessie sending in her Ekans (snake pokemon), and telling it to use bind attack to wrap up pikachu.	4	2	ホウ	つつ.む、くる.む	包む (つつ.む)
570	placenta	Bào (bào thai, đồng bào, tế bào)	胞	placenta, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, wrap, bound up, snake, self	9	21	Part of the body . . . wrap.		Imagine a newborn baby, fresh out of the womb, being entirely wrapped by the long piece of flesh, called a placenta, that once fed him.	Placenta is flesh/part of the body wrapped around the foetus.	JH	1	ホウ		
571	cannon	Pháo	砲	cannon, stone, rock, wrap, bound up, snake, self	10	21	Stones . . . wrap.		Primitive cannons fired stones wrapped with poisonous snakes.	Cannon = stone projectile wrapped by a barrel.	JH	1	ホウ		
572	bubble	Phao (bọt nước)	泡	bubbles, water, water droplets, water pistol, wrap, bound up, snake, self	8	21	Water . . . wrap.		When water forms a bubble, it wraps a pocket of air.	To prevent people from popping bubble wrap for fun, the post office has started filling the bubbles with water.	JH	1	ホウ	あわ	泡 (あわ)
573	tortoise	Qui (con rùa)	亀	tortoise, bound up, eels, sun, day	11	21	"This is not a turtle (See frame 250) but a tortoise, however you wish to picture the difference. Let the ""bound up"" at the to prefer to the head, and the two suns, with a long tail running through it, to the shell."	* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half, ⻲, and comes to mean eel. (If it is any help, this kanji in its full form can also be remembered through its abbreviation's primitive meaning.)	It seems bizarre, but tortoises are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. Where the shell comes from, no one knows.	A tortoise is prosperity bound up with a tail. They are very lucky creatures.	JH	1	キ、キュウ、キン	かめ	亀 (かめ)
574	electricity	Điện	電	electricity, rain, weather, eel, sun, day	13	21	Rain/weather . . . eel.		Think of a two natural sources of electricity: electrical storms (a form of weather) and electrical eels. 電話 でんわ phone, call.	This kanji was invented by the first Chinaman to discover electricity. He was so unfortunate, he stepped on an electric eel and got struck by lighting at the same time.	2	5	デン		
575	dragon	Long	竜	dragon, vase, stand up, eel, sun, day	10	21	Vase . . . eel. In order not to confuse this kanji with the zodiacal sign of the dragon, which we will meet later (Frame 2164) and use as a primitive, you might think here of a paper parade dragon.		Have you ever seen an asian DRAGON? it looks like an eel, but can stand up because it has legs.	If the poor villagers don´t provide him with a vase full of eels each day, the dragon will lay waste to the village.	JH	1	リュウ、リョウ、ロウ	たつ、いせ	
576	waterfall	Lang (thác nước)	滝	waterfall, water, water droplets, water pistol, dragon, vase, stand up, eel, sun, day	13	21	Water . . . vase . . . eels. To avoid the confusion mentioned in the previous frame, the character learned there for dragon should not be used as a primitive.		The Water Dragon dwells in the waterfall.	Ever went under a waterfall, vase in hand, trying to catch eels from the water as it pours down?	JH	1	ロウ、ソウ	たき	滝 (たき)
577	pork	Đồn (con lợn)	豚	pork, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sow, pig	11	21	Flesh . . . sow.		Pork comes from the flesh of a sow.	"One possible pictograph for ""sow"" primitive: the top line is a feeding trough, the stroke touching it is the head, the long curved stroke is the body (with a little hook at the end for the curly tail), and the four remaining strokes are the sow´s legs."	JH	1	トン	ぶた	豚 (ぶた)
578	pursue	Trục (đuổi theo, tranh giành: trục lợi)	逐	pursue, sow, pig, road	10	21	Sows . . . road.		In association with consummate (#540), our sow is on the road pursuing a mate.	The pig is on the road in the pursue of the turtle who is trying to escape (#283). (See story on escape (#283) & consummate (#540)).	JH	1	チク		
579	consummate	Toại (toại nguyện, thoả thích)	遂	consummate, horns, sow, pig, road	12	21	The horns atop the sow suggest a boar at work in the background. Add the element for a road. Now create a story whose meaning is: consummate.		This is still Miss Piggy only she´s gotten horny (as she often does) and now she´s pursuing Kermit to help her consummate her desires.	In association with pursue (#539), our sow has tracked down a suitable mate, they´ve consummated their relationship, and now the little sow is all grown up into a boar with horns.	JH	1	スイ	と.げる、つい.に	遂げる (と.げる)
580	house	Gia (gia đình)	家	house, sow, pig	10	21	"This is the full character whose primitive form we learned already. To help a little, this kanji recalls the times when the ""domestic"" animals were, as the word itself suggests, really kept in the house. Hence: house . . . sow."		"Think of ""The Three Little Pigs"". There was a house made of straw, another made of sticks, and a third made of bricks, each occupied by a pig. So, naturally, housetop over pig means house, the central element of that story."	Man, ever hear of cleaning? This house is a pig sty.	2	4	カ、ケ	いえ、や、うち	家屋 (かおく), 家庭 (かてい), 作家 (さっか), 家 (いえ), 家 (や)
581	marry into	Giá (đi lấy chồng: xuất giá)	嫁	marry into, woman, house, sow, pig	13	21	The kanji in this frame demonstrates the traditional Japanese approach to marriage: it is the woman who leaves her family for another household, thus marrying into a man's family.		Since the Nihonjin man is hardly ever home, the woman feels more like she´s married into the house than into a relationship.	Traditionally, it was the women who would marry into the households of their husband´s families.	JH	1	カ	よめ、とつ.ぐ、い.く、ゆ.く	嫁ぐ (とつ.ぐ), 嫁 (よめ)
582	overpowering	Hào (sáng suốt, trí tuệ hơn trăm người, hào hiệp, ý khí phi thường: hào kiệt)	豪	overpowering, tall, top hat, mouth, crown, sow, pig	14	21	Tall . . . crowned . . . sow.		In Orwell´s ´Animal Farm´ the pigs overpowered every other animals. They crownded themselves as ruler of the farm and walked tall on their rear legs, a crime strictly forbidden in the animal republic.	Ganon, the tall crowned pig, has been overpowering ther land of Hyrule for decades.	JH	1	ゴウ	えら.い	
583	intestines	Trường, tràng	腸	intestines, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, piggy bank, sun, day, piglets	13	21	Flesh . . . piggy bank.		Intestines are the part of the body that is taken out of piglets to make piggy banks. Just imagine factory workers scraping out the intestines of real piglets and packaging them up for little children.	Taking things too literally, you used a real piglet as a piggy bank. Now when you smash it open to get your coins out, you have to dig out your coins from its intestines. ew.	4	1	チョウ	はらわた	
584	location	Trường (hội trường, quảng trường)	場	location, soil, dirt, ground, piggy bank, sun, day, piglets	12	21	Soil . . . piggy bank.		You´re looking for a good location to bury your piggy bank savings. It has to be in some soft soil that´s easy to dig up, well hidden, and easy to remember like this kanji.	Don´t confuse with place (#1127). Think of location not as a single fixed spot, but as the act of locating. You´ve buried your piggy bank in the dirt in your backyard, but you can´t remember where. You frantically dig everywhere in a process of location to find your piggy bank.	2	4	ジョウ、チョウ	ば	場 (ば)
585	hot water	Thang (nước nóng)	湯	hot water, water, water droplets, water pistol, piggy bank, sun, day, piglets	12	21	Water . . . piggy bank.		Imagine a hot water kettle for your tea, except this one is a pink piggy bank that pours the water from its snout (and squeals when the water is piping hot). Make sure to use a potholder!	"Hot water is a phrase that can mean ""getting into trouble."" This kanji pictures just one of the many meanings of that phrase: it´s water that you get into (with creditors and the like) when your piggy bank is empty!"	3	2	トウ	ゆ	湯 (ゆ)
586	sheep	Dương (con dê, con cừu)	羊	sheep, horns	6	21	This pictograph shows the animal horns at the top attached to the head (3rd stroke), the front and back legs (strokes 4 and 5) and body (final stroke).	"* The primitive meaning of sheep can add the further connotations given in the following frame. As we saw with the cow, the ""tail"" is cut off when it is set immediately over another element: ⺷. Note the change in stroke order, as exemplified in the following frame."	Picture of a sheep run over by a steam roller. Must have been a ram, note the horns.	Our Lord and King put on ears and a tail to become a lowly sheep for the slaughter.	3	1	ヨウ	ひつじ	羊 (ひつじ)
587	beauty	Mỹ	美	beauty, sheep, large, St. Bernard	9	21	Try to think of what the Chinese were on to when they associated the idea of beauty with a large sheep.		I guess this kanji proves it´s not just the Welsh whose idea of beauty is a large sheep.	A Sheep on top of a dog is NOT a beautiful thing.	3	3	ビ、ミ	うつく.しい	美しい (うつく.しい)
588	ocean	Dương (bể lớn)	洋	ocean, water, water droplets, water pistol, sheep	9	21	Water . . . sheep. Be sure to keep the stories and key word of this kanji distinct from those for sea. (Frame 500).		This kanji refers to the waters of the Pasheephic ocean.	Remember the story of Jason and the Argonauts from Greek myth? Jason travelled across oceans of water in order to recover the fleece of a certain sheep.	3	4	ヨウ		
589	detailed	Tường (chi tiết, rõ ràng)	詳	detailed, say, words, keitai, mouth, sheep	13	21	Words/speaking . . . sheep.		"Trembling from head to hoof from such a traumatic experience, the sheep gives a very detailed worded account to the detective about his wolf attack. ""We need more details Mr. Sheep. Tell us exactly where the baaad man touched you""."	Say! detailed sheep, not like that! DE-TAILED sheep. Got it?	JH	1	ショウ	くわ.しい、つまび.らか	詳しい (くわ.しい)
590	fresh	Tiên (sáng, tươi)	鮮	fresh, fish, bound up, rice field, brains, oven-fire, barbecue, sheep	17	21	Fish . . . sheep.		"The freshest fish is caught in the middle of the night while most people are ""counting sheep."" (If you´ve ever been to Tsukiji fish market, you know what I mean)."	"This one´s easy to remember. The kanji gives 2 examples of foods that should be purchased fresh.

You may have to work with this one a while longer."		Dolly (the first cloned sheep ever) grow tired of being a celebrity and escaped from the labs by digging a tunnel. She turned out to be an ACCOMPLISHED escapist, as she managed to dig a road under the soil. /Imagine Dolly performing a escape, like those movies where the main character has to escape from jail.	The dirty sheep had come far down this road and had accomplished many things.	4	3	タツ、ダ	-たち	
592	envious	Tiện (tham muốn)	羨	envious, sheep, water, water droplets, water pistol, lack, yawn	13	21	Sheep . . . water . . . yawn/lack. Although this character looks rather simple, special care should be taken in learning it because of the proximity of the final two elements to the character for next, which we learned in frame 510. Note, too, that the water comes UNDER the sheep, rather than on its own to the left.		A very thirsty sheep, who always lacked water, spends his days watching his fellow sheep (in the farm next door or in another pen) and being very envious of their water.	Envious of the greener grass on the other side of the fence, the sheep looks down in disgust at his own dry grass lacking water.	JH		セン、エン	うらや.む、あまり	羨ましい (うらや.ましい), 羨む (うらや.む)

This New-Zealand pro-gamer has won many distinctions playing WoolCraft (a massively multi-user game in which the goal is to shear sheep).	Noob players make no distinction between what games they play, whether it´s the geniune thing or a bootleg fake copy. The biggest example of course, would be the legit World of Warcraft and the biggest ripoff there is: World of Wool-craft!	4	3	サ	さ.す、さ.し	差す (さ.す)

599	char	Tiêu (cháy)	焦	char, turkey, oven-fire, barbecue	12	21	Turkey . . . oven fire.		When I put the turkey over the oven fire, it always ends up being charred beyond recognition. I´m not a very good cook.	Char could be any meat over oven fire. So why is it a turkey in this kanji? Because charred turkey is what sticks out most in your mind as the thing that ruined Thanksgiving dinner.	JH	1	ショウ	こ.げる、こ.がす、こ.がれる、あせ.る	焦る (あせ.る), 焦がす (こ.がす), 焦がれる (こ.がれる), 焦げる (こ.げる)

They never look up and see the Turkeys that have gathered on top of the trees to hide. Those were some smart turkeys!	Gather the turkeys for Thanksgiving. Gather the trees for Christmas.

"Newscast: ""Among today´s miscellaneous stories, we have a report on a baseball team that was chased up a tree by a turkey. Stay tuned for this and more!""."	On the left we have baseball and wood, which obviously means a baseball bat. Instead of balls, there are miscellaneous other objects you may hit with it. While beating people may be one favorite use, in this case we see it used for making turkey mash.	5	3	ザツ、ゾウ	まじ.える、まじ.る	雑談 (ざつだん), 雑音 (ざつおん), 混雑 (こんざつ)
605	female	Thư (con cái)	雌	feminine, Prince, this here, stop, footprint, spoon, sitting on the ground, turkey	14	21	This character for female forms a pair with that for male, which we will learn later (Frame 804).

The St. Bernard dog pounces on a turkey in a rice field and stirs up all the other birds around. See them all gobble gobbling in fear?	Gruesome, but it makes it easy to remember.

608	rob	Đoạt (chiếm đoạt)	奪	rob, large, St. Bernard, turkey, glue	14	21	Whereas burglary (Frame 381) implies clandestine appropriation of another's property, robbery refers to taking by force. The primitive elements: St. Bernard dog . . . turkey . . . glue.		Remember the scene in A Christmas Story where the big dogs robbed the family of their Christmas turkey? Well, the following year Ralphie´s mom glued the holiday bird to the kitchen table, just as a precaution.	Don´t let the neighbor´s St.Bernard rob tonight´s turkey....glue it to the table if you must.

Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the ""chimney"" on the house doubled up with the first stroke of the turkey, we may see the right side as a turkey house (or ""coop""). We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive."		To assure that no one will get into the Turkey coop, put a huge rock in the entrance!	"You´ve heard the expression ""killing two birds with one stone."" (一石二鳥 is-seki-ni-chou). We´ll, there´s another one that roughly translates as ""killing an entire coop with a giant boulder.

610	noon	Ngọ (giữa chưa)	午	noon, horse, pantomime horse, noon, sign of the horse	4	21	With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of noon. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for cow (Frame 260).	* As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a horse. Any horse image will do, except that of a team of horses, which will come later (Frame 2132) and get its own primitive.	Noon is a good time for a ten minute nap (using lie down as nap).	Noon is the hour of the horse.	2	5	ゴ	うま	
611	permit	Hứa (cho phép)	許	permit, say, words, keitai, mouth, horse, pantomime horse, noon, sign of the horse	11	21	Words . . . horse.

If you've ever seen Disney's animated interpretation of classical music, ""Fantasia,"" you will recall what was done there with Beethoven's ""Pastoral Symphony"" (the 6th), and the flying horses that figured in it. The mares are bathing in the stream and the stallions begin to gather. As dusk sets in, the flying horses all start yawning and pair off for the night: a perfectly delightful portrait of delight."		Imagine a spoiled little girl. Her delight when she gets a Pegasus for her birthday... and then like all spoilt little girls she gets bored of it quickly... hence the yawn.	I would be delighted if Japanese lacked the Pegasus kanji.	JH	1	カン	よろこ.ぶ	
613	authority	Quyền (chính quyền)	権	authority, tree, wood, pegasus, horse, pantomime horse, noon, sign of the horse, turkey	15	21	Tree . . . Pegasus.		I have Eric Cartman of the “South Park” animated series, wearing a cop uniform, riding a wooden Pegasus (such as on a funfair), and yelling “RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH!!!”.

614	outlook	Quan (quan sát)	観	outlook, pegasus, horse, pantomime horse, noon, sign of the horse, turkey, see, telescope, eye, human legs	18	21	Pegasus . . . see.		Microsoft Outlook works about as well as a pegasus that can´t see: they both crash all the time.	I used to hate birds.They´re loud, stupid and worst of all they shit on your head. Used to think birds were the most vile creatures on earth. Then I encountered a pegasus. I was just walking down the road, minding my own business when I happened to look up. I saw it there, braying noisily, ivory wings outstretched like an angel, back leg raised ever so slightly. It dropped a steaming brown load right on my face. It changed my outlook completely. Birds are the second most vile creatures on earth.	4	3	カン	み.る、しめ.す	
615	feathers	Vũ (lông vũ, lông chim)	羽	feathers, wings	6	21	From the pictograph of two bird-wings, we get feathers.	* The related image of wings can be added as a primitive meaning. It can also take the form ョョ when used as a primitive, as we shall see in frames 618 and 619.	Pictograph. Easy enough.	These days the biggest concern in airline safety is ICE on the WINGS of the plane. Birds that fly long distances also have to worry about getting ICE on their FEATHERS.	2	2	ウ	は、わ、はね	羽 (は), 羽 (はね)
616	learn	Tập	習	learn, feathers, wings, white, dove	11	21	Feathers . . . white bird.		Imagine a white bird loosing a couple feathers as it is learning to fly. You learn a lesson as you watch it doing so, maybe you learn that “nothing comes for free” or that “one has to be prepared to loose in order to gain”...	Learning is all about adding more feathers to your cap and the most prestigious of all is the beautiful pure white feather you´ll receive when you have learned the kanji!	3	4	シュウ、ジュ	なら.う、なら.い	習う (なら.う)
617	the following	Dực (tiếp sau)	翌	the following, feathers, wings, vase, stand up	11	21	Feathers . . . vase. Be sure to contrast the connotation of this keyword with that for next (Frame 510).		The following segment is sponsored by...Swiffer - who make excellent feather dusters for cleaning your vases.	"Your feathers would also stand up if you were a hen in a slaughter house and you heard: ""The following!""."	6	2	ヨク		
618	weekday	Diệu (ngày trong tuần)	曜	weekday, sun, day, futon, feathers, wings, turkey	18	21	Day . . . feathers . . . turkey.		"Tip: feathers + turkey : This combination of primitives appears six times in Heisig, so it´s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest ""futon"" (your futon is made from turkey feathers). REF: weekday (FRAME 576) , laundry (#577), leap (#1285), outstanding (#2272), twinkle (#2534), shimmering (#2880). Story: On weekdays you hang your futon out in the sun."	The poor farmer spends every weekday while the sun shines, plucking turkey feathers.	2	4	ヨウ		
619	laundry	Trạc (rửa, giặt)	濯	laundry, water, water droplets, water pistol, futon, feathers, wings, turkey	17	21	Water . . . feathers . . . turkey		At the laundry you stuff your large futon (made from turkey feathers) in the machine, thereby causing it to break -- as shown by the water spurting out the side.	When turkeys do the laundry, they put their feathers in water (they don´t have clothes).	JH	2	タク	すす.ぐ、ゆす.ぐ	
620	sayeth	Viết (nói, lý do, viện cớ)	曰	sayeth, pent in, one	4	22	Pent in . . . one. The key word refers to famous sayings of famous people, and is the origin for the primitive meaning of a tongue wagging in the mouth that we learned in frame 12. The size of this kanji, a relatively rare one, is what distinguishes it from day.		"Sayeth?! Who the hell says ""sayeth""? Doesn´t seem quite right...just like this kanji, which is just like ""day"" but doesn´t seem ""quite right.""."	When pent up alone, one sayeth little.			エツ	いわ.く、のたま.う、のたま.わく、ここに、ひらび	
621	quandary	Khốn	困	quandary, pent in, tree, wood	7	22	Pent in . . . trees.		I´m supposed to make an enclosure for my tree, but if I use its wood for the enclosure, there won´t be anything left to be pent-in. What a quandary!	You are pent in the garden of eden with one tree, but outside is the whole world to explore! What a quandary -- should you stay in paradise with the tree of knowledge or should you go out into the world?	6	3	コン	こま.る	困る (こま.る)
622	harden	Cố (cố thủ. cố chấp)	固	harden, pent in, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	8	22	Old . . . pent in. Leave the people out of your story to avoid complications later when we add the element for person to form a new kanji (Frame 1047).		Fossils are old things pent in that have hardened.	Remember Metapod from Pokemon? All it used was harden, which kept it pent in until it grew old enough to evolve into Butterfree..	4	2	コ	かた.める、かた.まる、かた.まり、かた.い	固い (かた.い), 固まる (かた.まる), 固める (かた.める)
624	country	Quốc	国	country, pent in, king, jewel, ball, earring, drop	8	22	Jewels . . . pent in.		In my country (England) the crown jewels are kept pent-in in the Tower of London. Which happens to be where enemies of the state were once also pent-in (probably for trying to steal those jewels).

625	group	Đoàn (đoàn kết, đoàn đội)	団	group, pent in, glue	6	22	Glued . . . pent in.		When you are admitted into a group like the Yakuza, you´re well and truly done (だん) for. You must stick to the group like glue, and you will be pent-in for life, never being able to leave.	"A pent-in group will naturally be more cohesive, or ""glued together.""."	5	2	ダン、トン	かたまり、まる.い	団結 (だんけつ), 団地 (だんち), 集団 (しゅうだん)

We once had a dog with big paws // and oh what great trouble he´d cause // we built a huge pen // to keep him pent in // and stop him from breaking more laws //.

627	matrimony	Nhân (hôn nhân)	姻	matrimony, woman, cause, pent in, large, St. Bernard	9	22	"Woman . . . cause. Think here of the ""state of matrimony"" and you will not confuse it with other characters involving marriage, one of which we have already met (Frame 581)."		Matrimony is the state in which the woman has got you pent in like a dog so that you cannot go after other bitches.	When the woman gets angry, she treats her man like a pent in dog (i.e., puts him in the doghouse). It´s a perfect metaphor for the state of matrimony.	JH	1	イン

630	-times	Hồi (về, đi rồi trở lại)	回	times, pent in, mouth	6	22	"The suffix ""-times"" refers to a number of repetitions. Its elements: a mouth . . . pent in. Hint: you may find it more helpful to forget the primitives and think of one circle revovling inside of another."		Write mouth two -times.	Pretty much a pictograph, see book. Keyword meanings : to turn round, counter for number of times, counter for rounds. Some simple compounds using previously learned kanji : 次回 (next time), 毎回 (every time/each round), 回る (to wander around).	2	3	カイ、エ	まわ.る、-まわ.る、-まわ.り、まわ.す、-まわ.す、まわ.し-、-まわ.し、もとお.る、か.える	回答 (かいとう), 転回 (てんかい), 次回 (じかい), 回す (まわ.す), 回る (まわ.る)

With kanji as difficult as this one, it generally pays to toy with the various connotations of its primitives before settling on one image. Aim for as much simplicity as you can.		A man on the podium announce the rules for the contest: You must fill a top hat with dirt as many times as you can by nightbreak.	Abraham Lincoln used a simple mound of soil for a podium, when he wore his top hat and gave the speech he had practiced many times until nightbreak. But it was so magnificent that no one noticed.

639	heart	Tâm	心	heart, drops, fishhook, heart	4	22	This character, a pictographic representation of the heart, is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet.	* As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. In its kanji-form, it appears BENEATH or to the RIGHT of its relative primitive and means th physical organ of the heart. To the LEFT, it is abbreviated to three strokes, ⺖, and means a wildly emotional state of mind. And finally, at the very BOTTOM, it can take the form ⺗, in which case we give it the meaning of a valentine.	"The four chambers in the heart. In the West, we point to our head when asked about the mind. In the East, they point to the heart. So then, the radical for ""state of mind""…　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　シン　安心　あんしん(peace of mind)."

642	endure	Nhẫn	忍	endure, blade, sword, dagger, drop, heart	7	22	Blade . . . heart. Endure here means long-suffering patience.		A ninja must be able to endure the pain of clinging to a ceiling, motionless, for hours at a time, waiting for just the right moment to drop down and thrust the blade of his sword into the hearts of his enemies. By the way, this character is used in the compound 忍者 (ninja) which is why I choose to use ninja as its primitive meaning.	Someone with a razor blade stuck in their heart has to endure the pain wherever they go and can tell no one about it.	JH	1	ニン	しの.ぶ、しの.ばせる	忍ばせる (しの.ばせる), 忍ぶ (しの.ぶ)

651	think	Tư	思	think, rice field, brains, heart	9	22	Brains . . . heart.		Think with your brain NOT your heart.	To think is to use your brain over your heart.	2	4	シ	おも.う、おもえら.く、おぼ.す	思う (おも.う)
652	grace	Ân	恩	grace, cause, pent in, large, St. Bernard, heart	10	22	Take grace in its sense of a favor freely bestowed, not in its meaning of charming manners or fluid movement. The primitives: cause . . . heart.		Grace here is a favor freely bestowed, like a good deed. So to remember this kanji, go to the local shelter, find a big dog pent up in a small cage and adopt him. That will cause a warm feeling in your heart!	This kanji tells us that wherever heart is the cause, grace is the consequence. Think of “grace” as a graceful act: something benevolent that comes from the heart.	5	1	オン		
653	apply	Ứng (đáp ứng, phản ứng)	応	apply, cave, heart	7	22	"Cave . . . heart. The sense of the key word here is of something appropriate that fills a particular need, and hence ""applies."""		In the videogame Zelda, Link enters a CAVE to visit a fairy that will APPLY magic to fill his HEART containers.	"[bravo, scottamus!] To apply for the job as a (replacement) Batman, you have to make it to the heart of the cave past all the traps he set up to test you. There, you see a table with the application form on it. Now that you think about it, the ad in the paper did say ""Those who don´t make it to the heart of the cave need not apply.""."	5	1	オウ、ヨウ、ノウ	あた.る、まさに、こた.える

Picture someone who´s just had a great idea, but in place of a blinking light bulb over their head, you see a heart thumping with great noise. Imagine the greater the idea, the louder the sound of the beating heart.	3	4	イ		
656	concept	Tưởng	想	concept, inter milan, inter, tree, wood, eye, heart	13	22	"To distinguish this kanji from that of the previous frame, focus on the sense of the ""con-"" in the word ""concept.""

657	breath	Tức (Hơi thở)	息	breath, nose, drop, eye, heart	10	22	Nose . . . heart.		Your breath brings oxygen in through your nose which is then pumped around your body by your heart.

658	recess	Khế	憩	recess, tongue, thousand, mouth, nose, drop, eye, heart	16	22	Tongue . . . nose . . . heart. The sense of breath from the last frame should not be used; it could lead you to put only the nose over the heart and leave the tongue off to one side.		Recess to me is a school break. At recess some kiddies are comparing their latest body piercings. Tongues and noses are nothing special. The new cool is to have your heart done!	Ah recess; tongues slandering, noses being turned up, and beneath it all, young hearts being broken. Dominant in playgrounds is the noise of tongues, which helps me remember that in this kanji tongue comes first.	JH	1	ケイ	いこ.い、いこ.う	憩い (いこ.い), 憩う (いこ.う)
659	favor	Huệ	恵	favor, ten, needle, rice field, brains, heart	10	22	Ten . . . fields (or: needle . . . brains) . . . heart.		Too easy. Imagine the Wizard of OZ. There, the three heroes asked the Wizard for three FAVORS: the lion wanted courage of TEN men, the scarecrow wanted a BRAIN, and the tin man wanted a HEART. Ok, the lion bit is stretching but you have it memorized now, so who cares?	Do yourself a favor and take ten minutes to think about your decison...　RTK2:　エ　知恵　ちえ(wisdom)　　　ゴ　互恵　ごけい(reciprocal).

Beneath them, once again, the heart.		She was beguiled/mislead by his charm: at the party he kissed her on the mouth, they did it on the floor and thus he stole her heart. Poor girl!	The same cowboy from frame # 356 (elements mouth, floor and fiesta), kisses the floor with his mouth, once again, before going to the fiesta.

663	melancholy	Ưu (ưu phiền)	憂	melancholy, summer, head, page, crown, heart, walking legs	15	22	Head . . . crown . . . heart . . . walking legs. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of head with the top of the crown serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of melancholy figures should offer plenty of suggestions.)		Melancholy makes me think of Hamlet cause he was so ´emo´. In order to play up his feelings he bares his head and holds his crown over his heart then walks (on walking legs) around the palace making everyone see how melancholy he is. What a wuss.	This is an image of the crucifixion. Jesus is on the cross. His crown of thorns has slipped down and is around his neck, right between his head and his heart. His walking legs can be seen dangling from the cross as well. How MELANCHOLY!	JH	1	ユウ	うれ.える、うれ.い、う.い、う.き	憂い (う.い), 憂い (うれ.い), 憂える (うれ.える)
664	widow	Quả (goá chồng)	寡	widow, house, head, page, animal legs, eight, sword, dagger	14	22	House . . . head . . . dagger. Immediately we get another instance of a very odd exception. Notice how the final stroke of the head is lengthened, giving the final two strokes a chance to stretch out and make room for the dagger that fits in beneath.		The new widow sits in the house, her head in her lap (the extended stroke), her dagger in her husband.	The house´s head, her husband, was murdered with a dagger. You can still see the drops of blood above the dagger. She is now a widow.	JH	1	カ

668	lament	Điệu (thương tiếc)	悼	lament, Freud, state of mind, eminent, magic wand, augury, sun, day, ten, needle	11	22	To keep this character distinct from others of similar connotation, one need only think of the Prophet Jeremiah whose poetry gave an eminence to the state of mind we call lamentation.		When the world´s most eminent magician died, everyone´s state of mind became that of lamentation. He was buried with his famous sun-flower wand in his hand.	Data laments that he could never see his eminent father, his creator, ever again. He paints a picture of his father, that looks like a sunflower in the shape of a magic wand.	JH	1	トウ	いた.む	悼む (いた.む)
669	enlightenment	Ngộ (tỉnh ngộ)	悟	enlightenment, Freud, state of mind, I, five, mouth	10	22	"I know of an Indian religious sect which teaches that enlightenment is to be had by covering the eyes with one's index fingers, the ears with the thumbs, and the mouth with the little fingers. While these differ a bit from the five holes that we used to represent the ""I"" (frame 17), the idea of achieving a special state of mind by covering those five places can help you learn this kanji. You might try the position out while you are learning this character."		Enlightenment is a state of mind that goes beyond the five senses.	"Data finds enlightenment when he discovers the answer to the question, ""Who am I?"". (Image: Data meditating in a sitting lotus position)."	JH	1	ゴ	さと.る	悟る (さと.る)
670	dreadful	Bố (hãi, khủng bố)	怖	dreadful, Freud, state of mind, linen, by one’s side, towel	8	22	State of mind . . . linen.		Someone in a dreadful state of mind has crawled into his bed and is hiding under the sheets (linens).	Being an android, Data is white as a sheet.

671	disconcerted	Hoảng (hốt hoảng, hoảng loạn)	慌	disconcerted, Freud, state of mind, laid waste, wreath, flowers, deceased, perish, top hat, fishhook, stream, flood	12	22	State of mind . . . laid waste.		(re: wazzab) The state of mind of the people of New Orleans as they examined their city´s concert hall laid waste can best described as disconcerted.	"Data walks in and sees Picard weeping. ""What is the matter, Captain?"" Picard looks up, and replies that his entire home planet has been laid to waste. Data, the master of tact, offers up this consolation: ""Ah. I can see how that would be DISCONCERTing"". It turns out that the flow of tears was really just because Picard had lost his chance at getting at some rare (and thus valuable) flowers on his home planet."

Pining, yearn for... etc. Presumably for lost love. An easy one here, someone standing in the graveyard, placing an old valentine card amonst all the existing tributes.

Annexed to the U.S.A. in 1898, Hawaii is nestled in the waters of the Pacific, a little drop of heaven, often visited on Valentines.. (from Ihatobu with the date corrected.

685	invariably	Tất (tất nhiên, tất yếu)	必	invariably, heart, stick, drop, fishhook, drop3	5	22	"First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the heart, even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph ""dividing"" the heart in half, then one has one of those invariably true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each heart is divided into two halves."		You swear you´ll be in love forever, but invariably there comes a time when your heart is divided.	For this kanji I invariably got the stroke order wrong. I nearly lost heart, but decided to stick (pun) to it. Then I noticed the order is 1) katakana ソ (altered slightly); 2) fishhook; 3) two drops. Now I invariably get it right.	4	3	ヒツ	かなら.ず	必ず (かなら.ず)

687	hand	Thủ (tay, thủ đoạn)	手	hand	4	23	Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a hand in this character. But that it is, and so you must.	* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single hand all by itself.	This pictograph actually really works if you look at it as a hand with fingers spread and middle finger pointing down. see the very top stroke as the edge of a shirt cuff, and it will all come together.	A hand is useful for 千一(1001) things.	1	4	シュ、ズ	て、て-、-て、た-	手 (て)
688	watch over	Khán (khán giả)	看	watch over, hand, eye	9	23	Hand . . . eyes.		It´s a hot day of summer with a clear sky, you´re sitting outside a cafe (or maybe on a reclining chair in the garden), and you watch over the kids with a hand covering your eyes from the sunlight (next time, don´t forget the sunglasses).

690	ego	Ngã (bản ngã)	我	ego, hand, fiesta	7	23	Hand . . . fiesta. Note how the second stroke of the hand is stretched across to double up as the first stroke of the tasseled arrow we use for fiesta. Compare to frames 17, 36, and 564.		"Someone with a huge EGO is too good for any romantic partner and as such has nothing but personal ""hand fiestas"" with himself every night."

691	righteousness	Nghĩa	義	righteousness, sheep, ego, hand, fiesta	13	23	Sheep . . . ego.		On the other hand, Woman tend to have too much self-righteousness to allow any man to touch their wooly black sheep this results in similar hand fiestas.	Righteous Christians are sheep with egos (reworked from raulir, fixes word order to match radical order).	5	1	ギ		
692	deliberation	Nghị (nghị luận)	議	deliberation, say, words, keitai, mouth, righteousness, sheep, ego, hand, fiesta	20	23	Words . . . righteousness.

693	sacrifice	Hi (hi sinh)	犠	sacrifice, cow, righteousness, sheep, ego, hand, fiesta	17	23	Cow . . . righteousness. Do NOT use the image of an animal sacrifice here, as that will have it own character later on.		A cow that is righteous sacrifices her milk for the human race.	Cows are truly righteous animals. They SACRIFICE their milk so that we can have some. And if they don´t have any left, they give a sheep a hand fiesta (good lord this is going too far) and give us that instead. What righteous cows.

You may think of ""bound with snakes"" as a description of the fingers slithering around the buttocks, if you want a particularly graphic image."	Here, I´m picturing that scene from ET (the extra terrestrial), where ET hugs Elliot before leaving. You see that EMBRACE is ET´s long FINGERS that WRAP around Elliot.

I think it helps simplify the image, and also helps anchor the pagoda kanji in memory better as an added bonus. say this aloud once, and i think it will bring out a vivid image very quickly: ""Now boarding the pagoda ride. Please keep your fingers inside at all times...""."	When you board the ship on the way out from Hawaii a beautiful crewmember takes her fingers and fits a lei around you ....a lei is flowers fitted together with your fingers.	JH	1	トウ

702	beckon	Chiêu (vẫy)	招	beckon, finger, fingers, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth	8	23	Finger . . . seduce.		A Geisha beckons you with her index finger, and as you approach she runs her fingers all over her body in an attempt to seduce you. Keyword meaning : “invite”.

703	clear the land	Thác (khai thác)	拓	clear the land, finger, fingers, stone, rock	8	23	Fingers . . . rocks.		A huge index finger coming down from the sky is kicking boulders of rock, clearing the land. Maybe it´s the finger of God preparing a place for his little people to live.	I imagine clearing the land in order to set up your tent after a long day of backpacking. Using your fingers, you pick up all of the rocks and get them out of the way so that you can get a comfortable night sleep. If you don´t clear the land you can just picture the rock sticking into your back as you toss and turn all night long.	JH	1	タク	ひら.く

733	nose	Tỵ (mũi)	鼻	nose, drop, eye, rice field, brains, two hands	14	23	Let me share a rather grotesque image to help with this kanji. Imagine taking your two hands and reaching up into someone's nostrils. Once inside you grab hold of the brain and yank it out.

An Egyptian embalmer reaching both hands into the dead pharaoh´s nose and yanking out handfuls of brain.	I sneezed so hard that through my NOSE I blew out my BRAINS into BOTH HANDS.	3	2	ビ	はな	鼻 (はな)
734	punish	Hình (hình phạt)	刑	punish, two hands, sword, sabre, saber	6	23	Two hands . . . saber.		This kanji is for severe punishment.

735	mould	Hình (mô hình)	型	mould, punish, two hands, sword, sabre, saber, soil, dirt, ground	9	23	Punish . . . soil. In cases like this, you might find it easier to break the character up into its more basic elements, like this: two hands . . . saber . . . soil.		A famous ninja once pressed his two hands and saber into the soil of his temple, before going onto a mission from which he never came back. Think of some sort of signature that he left behind him.

736	genius	Tài	才	genius, genius, genie	3	23	"Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special ""genius"" - one can do very easily, ""with one finger"" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for fingers backwards."	* The primitive meaning, genie, derives from the roots of the word genius. Use the genie out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered, and the meaning becomes a genie in the bottle.	"Spinal tap: ""Every other band´s amps go to ten. But you see my extra stroke of genius - these go to eleven.""."	A TEN year old had a STROKE of GENIUS and wrote this joke: 何歳ですか？　　　。。。天才です！.	2	3	サイ		
737	property	Tài (tài sản)	財	property, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, genie	10	23	Clam . . . genie.		If you´re a money genius, you can afford a lot of property.	The keyword refers to property in the sense of money or funds rather than of buildings or real estate. Keep this one distinct from frame 193 (“wealth”) and frame 473 (“assets”). Here we have a genie, gulping down oysters. Someone tries to grab an oyster and the genie puts his big arms around his oysters and states his “right of ownership” : “They´re mines, my property!”.	5	3	ザイ、サイ、ゾク	たから	財産 (ざいさん), 私財 (しざい), 文化財 (ぶんかざい)

739	suppose	Tồn (tồn tại, bảo tồn)	存	suppose, genie, child	6	23	"Genie in the bottle . . . a child. Hint: focus on the key word's connotation of ""make believe""."		How do you suppose they manage to cram a genie inside a bottle? Well, I suppose they put him in there while he´s still a little child...	Villagers on a little remote island one day find a bottle washed out by the sea onto the beach. After wiping the bottle and taking a closer look, they are amazed to see a (very small) child in it. The villagers suppose that the child is a genie in a bottle.	6	3	ソン、ゾン		存在 (そんざい), 存続 (そんぞく), 既存 (きぞん)
740	exist	Tại (tồn tại)	在	exist, genie, soil, dirt, ground	6	23	Genie in the bottle . . . soil.		Genie in the bottle does exist but you need to dig deep into the soil to find one.	You wipe the soil from the bottle, only to have a genie float out above you, saying: ´I am the genie in a bottle, what is your wish?´ So now you know that they do exist.	5	3	ザイ	あ.る	在る (あ.る)
741	from	Nãi (?)	乃	from, fist, from	2	23	"This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the ""hand primitives."" Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a fist (the primitive meaning) ""from"" this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word."	* The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a fist.	FROM a pictograph of a thumbs up. That´s how it also gets the primitive meaning of fist.	"Think Charlton Heston: ""From my cold, dead fists"". Speech given to the National Boxing Association, in response to stricter control on boxing gloves."	Names	1	ナイ、ダイ、ノ、アイ	の、すなわ.ち、なんじ	
742	portable	Huề (mang theo)	携	portable, finger, fingers, turkey, fist, from	13	23	Fingers . . . turkey . . . fist.		"This character is the ""kei"" in ""keitai"" (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. Imagine you´ve just arrived in Japan, but don´t have a cell phone yet, so instead you´re carrying around a portable turkey (phone) you can hold in your fist. To dial a number, just poke it with your fingers."	Because they have no fingers, turkeys must use their fists when dialing on a portable phone.	JH	1	ケイ	たずさ.える、たずさ.わる	携える (たずさ.える), 携わる (たずさ.わる)
743	reach out	Cập (phổ cập)	及	reach out, fist, from, drop	3	23	The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched fist into the kanji for reaching out, much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance.	* As a primitive, this shall stand for outstretched hands. Only take care not to confuse it with that for beg (Frame 501)	I like to think of this as a fist with with brass knuckles because of the extra line. An old school thug reaches out to help you up but then with his other hand ( with the brass knuckles) punches you.	Reach out and fist someone (Do you see the person primitive?).	JH	1	キュウ	およ.ぶ、およ.び、および、およ.ぼす	及び (およ.び), 及ぶ (およ.ぶ), 及ぼす (およ.ぼす)
744	suck	Hấp (hô hấp)	吸	suck, mouth, reach out	6	23	Mouth . . . outstretched hands. Hint: use the image of a nursing baby.

An open mouth and reaching hands : a baby wants to suck at his mother´s breast.	6	3	キュウ	す.う	吸う (す.う)
745	handle	Tráp (đối xử)	扱	handle, finger, fingers, reach out	6	23	Finger . . . outstretched hands.		See suck (#689): if it´s too big to handle, just use your fingers instead...	One of the first thing a baby can do with his hand is to reach out and grab your finger as if it was a little handle.	JH	1	ソウ、キュウ	あつか.い、あつか.う、あつか.る、こ.く	扱う (あつか.う)
746	length	Trượng (= 10 thước)	丈	length, stick, tucked under the arm	3	23	The length whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with arms at full length. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from large (Frame 112).		Both a meter and a yard are about one arm-length.	"This kanji reminds me of the kanji for big (I think it looks the same kinda of except for the last stroke). Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare ""length"" with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn´t show ""it"" but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your length. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji."	JH		ジョウ	たけ、だけ	丈 (たけ)
747	history	Sử	史	history, mouth, tucked under the arm	5	23	A mouth . . . tucked under the arm.		I sleep in history class with my mouth tucked under my arm.

748	officer	Lại (quan lại)	吏	officer, history, length, stick, one, mouth, tucked under the arm	6	23	One . . . mouth . . . tucked under the arm.		One officer can change the course of history.	One officer, namely Napoleon, changed the course of history. (Thanks, ayoung24). Napoleon is also my primitive meaning.	JH	1	リ		
749	grow late	Canh (đổi mới v một đêm chia ra 5 canh)	更	grow late, Ameratasu, one, ceiling, sun, tucked under the arm	7	23	The implication behind the meaning of grow late is that things are changing in the same way that the day turns into night. The elements: ceiling . . . sun . . . tucked under the arm.		At nightbreak (#30) the sun rises above the floor, so it is logical that when it is growing late, the sun would rise to the ceiling. Time to pack up your things and take your belongings under your arm.	It´s starting to GROW LATE, so God will take the SUN, and TUCK IT UNDER HIS ARM, and walk away. In the morning, he´ll bring it back, so don´t worry.	JH	3	コウ	さら、さら.に、ふ.ける、ふ.かす	更 (さら), 更かす (ふ.かす), 更ける (ふ.ける)
750	stiff	Ngạnh (ngang ngạnh)	硬	stiff, stone, rock, grow late, Ameratasu, one, ceiling, sun, tucked under the arm	12	23	Rocks . . . grow late.		A stiff drink on the ROCKs after it GROWS LATE is a way to unwind after a long day...	Stones are so stiff that even if you spent all day straining trying to change their shape, it would grow late far before you ever accomplished your task.	JH	2	コウ	かた.い	硬い (かた.い)
752	or again	Hựu	又	or again, crotch	2	23	"Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate ""and"" (+, &, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of or again."	* As a primitive, it will mean crotch, as in the crotch of the arm. Or whatever.	"After her boyfriend´s crotch has been satisfied, a woman might suggest they cuddle. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might say, ""Or again, we could fool around . . . ""."	"This keyword should really be ""again"" not ""or again"" Here is some context: think of the phrase ""Jya mata"" ""じゃ又"" which is a farewell similar to ""then again"". Also ""Mata ne"" ""又ね"" and mata ashita (again tomorrow) ""又明日""。 Note this kanji is rarely used, most of the time JP people spell it out ""mata"" except for in the last example: 又明日."	JH	1	ユウ	また、また-、また.の-	又 (また)
753	pair	Song (song sinh)	双	pair, crotch, crotch2	4	23	The crotch reduplicated gives us a pair.		Crotch to crotch is how many pairs spend their private time together. . .	The animals boarding Noah´s Ark all came in pairs – but Noah had to carefully check the two crotches in each pair to ensure that the animals were of different sexes and thus able to further their species after the flood.

754	mulberry	Tang (cây dâu)	桑	mulberry, crotch, tree, wood, crotch3	10	23	"Crotches, crotches everywhere . . . tree. Hint: think of a group of children playing an original version of ""Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush."""		"Children going around the mulberry tree singing ""This is the way we wash our crotch, wash our crotch, wash our crotch...""."	Imagine kids all over the top of a mulberry tree, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their crotches. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old mulberry in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly).	JH	1	ソウ	くわ	桑 (くわ)
755	vessels	Chích (đếm thuyền)	隻	vessels, turkey, crotch	10	23	The key word indicates the Japanese generic term for counting ships. Its elements: turkey . . . crotch.		On Vessels that travel long distances, sailors often get quite lonely. They keep TURKEYS on the VESSELS, but not for use as food. The lonely sailors take turns enjoying the turkey´s CROTCH.	Donald Duck is a big bird that does not wear pants. It´s good to use him as a mnemonic because he is a sailor, and this kanji is used to count vessels.	JH	2	セキ		
756	safeguard	Hộ (bảo hộ)	護	safeguard, say, words, keitai, mouth, radio caroline, flowers, vessels, turkey, crotch	20	23	Words . . . flowers . . . vessels.		Think of the flower-vessels as a the Greenpeace vessel “Arctic Sunrise”, only instead of a rainbow there is a big flower painted on the hull (this will come back in seize (#701) and harvest (#908)). Think of “flower-power” and of the “peace” in “Greenpeace” and it will make some sense hopefully. -- In this kanji, we see an inauguration speech being given before the Greenpeace vessel is set afloat and sent to safeguard our planet.	(With sarcasm) A Bush speech telling how all the US vessels are always welcomed, covered with flowers and words of gratitude for safeguarding democracy from the evil doers.	5	1	ゴ	まも.る	
757	seize	Hoạch	獲	seize, pack of wild dogs, radio caroline, flowers, vessels, turkey, crotch	16	23	A pack of wild dogs . . . flowers . . . vessels. Do not confuse this with the character for arrest (Frame 706).		A pack of genetically-modified wild dogs is seized by a group of Greenpeace activists and taken onboard the Greenpeace vessel (the flower vessel, see safeguard (#700)).	Customs just seized a crate of poppies (flowers) detected by trained wild dogs who inspected the vessel.	JH	1	カク	え.る	獲る (え.る)
758	guy	Nô (nô lệ, nô dịch)	奴	guy, woman, crotch	5	23	Woman . . . crotch.		"That GUY stole my WOMAN so I kicked him in the CROTCH. (This story helps keep the word ""GUY"" as someone you hold in contempt)."	Guys only care about 2 things: women and their crotch (preferably at the same time).	JH	1	ド	やつ、やっこ	
759	angry	Nộ (thịnh nộ)	怒	angry, guy, woman, crotch, heart	9	23	Guy . . . heart.		This woman is angry because of the guys in the previous frame who pay more attention to her crotch than her heart. I prefer to decompose the kanji in three elements here because it is easier to read like a mnemonic.	WOMEN get very ANGRY over the thought that GUYS are more interested in her CROTCH than her HEART.	JH	3	ド、ヌ	いか.る、おこ.る	怒る (いか.る), 怒る (おこ.る)
760	friend	Hữu	友	friend, by one’s side, crotch	4	23	By one's side . . . crotch.		A good friend is always at your side. ---- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other´s crotches in a joking manner. It´s still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor´s crotch is a great way to express friendship.	Think of a sex friend (a fuck buddy if you will).

761	slip out	Bạt (rút ra)	抜	slip out, finger, fingers, friend, woman, crotch	7	23	Fingers . . . friend.		Don´t let good friends slip out between your fingers.

762	throw	Đầu (đầu tư)	投	throw, finger, fingers, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	7	23	Fingers . . . missile.		Well, you usually use your fingers to throw objects used as missile weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the missile primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it´s a crotch (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the wind. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers...	"If you use the primitive ""semen"" (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story."	3	3	トウ	な.げる、-な.げ	投げる (な.げる)
763	drown	Một (?)	没	drown, water, water droplets, water pistol, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	7	23	Water . . . missile.		(Note: this kanji is more collapse/cave-in/sink (#1888) than humans drowning) A water missile? A torpedo! And when it hits it´s target? The ship collapses then sinks and everyone drowns!	"The submarine´s hull was breached after being struck by a torpedo (""water missile""), causing the entire crew to drown."	JH	1	ボツ、モツ	おぼ.れる、しず.む、ない	
765	establishment	Thiết (thiết lập)	設	establishment, say, words, keitai, mouth, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	11	23	Words . . . missile.

766	beat	Kích (công kích, tập kích)	撃	beat, tank, car, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch, hand	15	23	Car . . . missile . . . hand.		Your car has missles?! That beats mine, hands down.	Think 3 methods of attack all combined into 1 kanji: 1. Vehicle to transport troops 2. Once troops have disembarked they have their missiles 3. If they run out of missiles they resort to hand to hand combat to beat the enemy.	JH	1	ゲキ	う.つ	撃つ (う.つ)

768	branch	Chi (chi nhánh)	支	branch, ten, needle, crotch	4	23	Needle . . . crotch.		Picture sliding down the branch of a tree (in this case a pine tree or any tree with needles) and getting a bunch of needles stuck in your crotch--ouch!!	A special branch of the military called the Needle Crotch Unit. Their only weapon is the needle embedded in their crotches, and they´re quite adept at using them.	5	3	シ	ささ.える、つか.える、か.う、しんよう、じゅうまた	支える (ささ.える)
769	skill	Kĩ (kĩ thuật)	技	skill, finger, fingers, branch, ten, needle, crotch	7	23	Fingers . . . branch.		(Adapted from darg_sama´s) Balancing a branch on your finger is the prototypical example of a skill that is nothing more than a skill (i.e., it is completely useless).	I think of a guy balancing a branch on his finger, which definitely takes some minimal amount of skill.	5	2	ギ	わざ	技 (わざ)
770	bough	Chi (chi nhánh)	枝	bough, tree, wood, branch, ten, needle, crotch	8	23	Tree . . . branch. Take a moment to focus on the differences between a bough, a branch, and a twig (Frame 319).		The tree´s primary branch is known as the bough.	Differentiate between BOUGH and branch (#711): ´branch´ is smaller, and can also refer to the branch of a store (支店), which has nothing to do with a tree. But a BOUGH is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large boughs, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical.	5	2	シ	えだ	枝 (えだ)
771	limb	Chi	肢	limb, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, branch, ten, needle, crotch	8	23	Part of the body . . . branch.

772	stalk	Hành (thân cây cỏ)	茎	stalk, flowers, spool, clod, toilet paper, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	8	23	Flower . . . spool.		PRIMITIVE: soiled crotch = soiled underwear. To precent anyone from picking the beautiful flower, the gardner hung soiled underwear on the stalk.	"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) Toilet paper/roll usually comes on a spool. (2) Toilet paper is used to clean the soil off your crotch. Story: Just get a flower and carefully wrap some toilet paper around its stalk. Spool also appears in suspicious (#716), lightly (#717), diameter (#882), sutra (#1360)."	JH	1	ケイ、キョウ	くき	茎 (くき)
773	suspicious	Quái (kì quái)	怪	suspicious, Freud, state of mind, spool, clod, toilet paper, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	8	23	State of mind . . . spool.		When you´re suspicious, your state of mind twists round and round like a spool of thread.	Imagine a loud farting sound on The Enterprise (sorry). Everyone looks around trying to find who did it.

Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called light vehicles here. Imagine a so-called light vehicle or a light-truck with a load of spools driving down a road ever so lightly, careful not to let any of the spools roll out onto the street.	I want to tread lightly on the environment.... That´s why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday.... I know, lame.	3	2	ケイ	かる.い、かろ.やか、かろ.んじる	軽い (かる.い), 軽やか (かろ.やか)
775	uncle	Thúc	叔	uncle, above, small, little, crotch	8	23	Above . . . little . . . crotch.		Oh come on people - say what we´ve all been thinking: the uncle is that creepy guy towering above a little one´s crotch.	Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let´s make one story: Your UNCLE was full of loneliness (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself. He was naturally graceful (#721) (淑) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team). You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he watched over you carefully as coach (#719) (督). It was uncomfortable, though, how your uncle (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...	JH	1	シュク

Uncle (the one who is lonely and coaches kids in his spare time) is actually a graceful guy once he hits the water, as he used to be part of the swimming team in his youth.

779	anti-	Phản	反	anti-, demonstation, cliff, crotch	4	23	Cliff . . . crotch.		I think of an anti-hero (Dirty Harry etc.) for this primitive, whose trademark for disposing of villians is not an honorable fight, but a kick in the crotch and then a shove off a cliff (perhaps whilst the villain´s back is turned).	Many cultures are so anti-sex you´d think they just want people to throw their crotches over a cliff.	3	3	ハン、ホン、タン、ホ	そ.る、そ.らす、かえ.す、かえ.る、-かえ.る	反映 (はんえい), 反対 (はんたい), 違反 (いはん), 謀反 (むほん), 反らす (そ.らす), 反る (そ.る)
780	slope	Phản (cái dốc)	坂	slope, soil, dirt, ground, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch	7	23	Ground . . . anti-.		As the villain (pushed off by the anti-hero) is tumbling down the slope, he activates gadget skis to escape, spraying soil everywhere as he flies down the slope.	This kanji depicts a classic enviornmental problem: erosion. Erosion occurs when all of the soil washes of the side of the cliff, eventually causing the cliff to disappear, leaving a slope (an anti- cliff if you will) in its place.	3	2	ハン	さか	坂 (さか)
781	plank	Bản (tấm bảng)	板	plank, tree, wood, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch	8	23	Tree . . . anti-.		Of course, trees are anti-plank. Wouldn´t you be if you were a tree?	Trees are naturally opposed to, or anti, the making of planks.	3	2	ハン、バン	いた	乾板 (かんばん), 鉄板 (てっぱん), 板 (いた)
782	return	Phản (trả lại)	返	return, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch, road	7	23	Anti- . . . road.		Pretty obvious: to return is to turn back on the road you´re on and go the opposite way.	"In ""The Return of the anti-hero"", Clint Eastwood kicks the villain in the crotch, pushes them off the cliff and onto a busy highway.

784	claw	Trảo (móng, vuốt)	爪	claw, vulture	4	23	This character is a pictograph of a bird's claw, and from there comes to mean animal claws in general (including human fingernails).	* As a primitive, we shall use the graphic image of a vulture, a bird known for its powerful claws. It generally appears above another primitive, in which case it gets squeezed into the form ⺥.	A pictograph of Wolverine´s adamantium claws.	Pictograph, see book. * I prefer the primitive meaning of an eagle rather than vulture. Somehow vulture makes me think more about meat and dead corpses than claws. An eagle however immediately brings to my mind the image of an eagle plunging into a stream catching fish in his claws, or that of the great eagles rescuing Bilbo and his party in Jrr Tolkien´s novel “Bilbo the Hobbit”.

785	gentle	Thoả (thoả hiệp)	妥	gentle, claw, vulture, woman	7	23	Vulture . . . woman.		Overly gentle women are vultures who want to marry you and steal your money - not true but an easy mnemonic!	An eagle must be extra gentle to pick up a dainty woman in its sharp claws.	JH	1	ダ		
786	milk	Nhũ	乳	milk, fledgling, claw, vulture, child, fishhook	8	23	Fledglings . . . hook.		A fledgling is being nursed at a zoo, it is fed milk through a small tube that is bent in the shape of a hook (so that it fits inside its beak). The fledgling soon becomes addicted to milk, giving us this very catchy mnemonic: “fledgling hooked on milk”.	Drinking milk not only reduces cavity (#96)´s but also strengthens nails (claws) thanks astgtciv.	6	2	ニュウ	ちち、ち	乳 (ち), 乳 (ちち)
787	floating	Phù (phù du)	浮	floating, water, water droplets, water pistol, fledgling, claw, vulture, child	10	23	Water . . . fledglings.		Floating rubber ducky!!!	A nest of fledglings somehow fell into the water (maybe it was perched on a tree bending over the river), but they are safe for now as the nest is floating. The fledglings are enjoying the cruise but they are soon coming to a great waterfall... ( a little drama to help us remember the story).

789	leader	Tướng	将	leader, turtle, claw, vulture, glue	10	23	Turtle . . . vulture . . . glue.		The leader in this race is the turtle! It appears he has covered the vulture’s feet in glue, so that the vulture cannot get off the starting block.	X-men and TMNT join forces: Their new leader is an awsome asshole.

790	exhort	Tưởng (?)	奨	exhort, leader, turtle, claw, vulture, glue, large, St. Bernard	13	23	Leader . . . St. Bernard dog. Do not confuse with urge (Frame 300).

"Tip: vulture + tree : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called grab (#2090). Story: As you go to pick your nose, your parent grabs your finger and pulls it away (& gives you a lecture on social etiquette).

Can´t you just picture this ridiculously polite S&M picture? A businessman, who DOTH the bidding of his taskmistress, is climaxing and yelling out ""お願い致します"" while she whips and says ""どう致しまして"". (This kanji also means ""to bring about"" and ""do humbly"", which is perfect for this image)."	JH	1	チ	いた.す	致す (いた.す)
819	mutually	Hỗ (tương hỗ)	互	mutually, one, ceiling, one, floor	4	23	When you draw this character think of linking two walls together, one right side up and the other upside down.		The 69 position allows both parties to mutually give themselves pleasure.	If you can combined your walls with another house´s walls, both houses would mutually benefit, by the increase in size....	JH	3	ゴ	たが.い、かたみ.に	互い (たが.い)
820	abandon	Khí (từ bỏ)	棄	abandon, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, buckle, tree, wood	13	23	Infant . . . buckle (See frame 444) . . . tree.		Think of a really loud and annoying baby, you want to abandon it but it keeps coming back...so you take of your belt by the buckle, and buckle the baby to a tree!	As in sash (#415), I treat the one mountain in the middle to mean Mt. Fuji (Japan´s ichiban mountain). Now we see an infant being abandoned on top of Mt. Fuji well above the tree line to die of exposure.	JH	1	キ	す.てる	
821	bring up	Dục (giáo dục)	育	bring up, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	8	23	Since the key word has to do with raising children to be strong both in mind and body, it is easy to coordinate the primitive elements: infant . . . meat.		Bringing up your offspring means raising them from infant until they are meat ready to be harvested. What, cannibalism is in poor taste? Forget I ever brought it up. But bring up will forver be infant meat to me. I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs!	I will bring up my infants to eat meat. I´ll not endure any vegetarian children in my house!	3	3	イク	そだ.つ、そだ.ち、そだ.てる、はぐく.む	育つ (そだ.つ), 育てる (そだ.てる)
822	remove	Triệt	撤	remove, finger, fingers, borstal, bring up, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, taskmaster	15	23	Fingers . . . bring up . . . taskmaster.		Don´t lay a finger on him, a concerned mother says as the state REMOVES her child away for upbringing by a taskmaster foster home.	A terrible yakuza taskmaster is bringing up his infant. Every time the infant does something wrong... well, you know what happens to yakuzas when they do something wrong.	JH	1	テツ		
823	allot	Sung (sung túc, bổ sung)	充	allot, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, human legs	6	23	Infant . . . human legs.		"Scene at the baby factory: Manager: ""Good news! Your infant has been allotted human legs"". Parent to be: ""Thanks a lot!""."	In China, to prevent too many human legs walking around, couples are alloted only one infant…　RTK2:　ジュウ　補充　ほじゅう(supplement)…　Semi-Pure Group:　銃762　(ﾄｳ): 統1347.	JH	1	ジュウ	あ.てる、み.たす	充てる (あ.てる)
824	gun	Súng	銃	gun, metal, gold, allot, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, human legs	14	23	Metal . . . allot.		Everyone is allotted a metal gun (US constitution according to the NRA).	What is a gun but a device for allotting pieces of metal? One for you - BANG!...One for you - BANG!...One for you - BANG!...One for you - BANG!...etc.	JH	1	ジュウ	つつ	
825	sulfur	Lưu	硫	sulphur, stone, rock, lifebelt, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, stream, flood	12	23	Rock . . . infant . . . flood.		Sulphur is like a rock, but it can stink like a stream of infant doodie.	Infants are baptised in streams inorder to prevent their descent into a place of sulphur and brimstone.	JH	1	リュウ		
826	current	Lưu (hạ lưu, lưu hành)	流	current, water, water droplets, water pistol, lifebelt, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, stream, flood	10	23	Water . . . infant . . . flood. Be sure to distinguish the two water primitives from one another in making your story.		INFANT Moses placed in the WATER and sent down the current of the STREAM.	A water-breathing infant (genetically modified?) is caught in a flood, and drifts with the current, apparently enjoying himself in the process.	3	3	リュウ、ル	なが.れる、なが.れ、なが.す、-なが.す	流行 (りゅうこう), 流動 (りゅうどう), 電流 (でんりゅう), 流す (なが.す), 流れる (なが.れる)
827	license	Doãn (thành thực, ưng thuận)	允	license, elbow, human legs	4	23	Elbow . . . human legs.		In some Asian kung-fu version of James Bond, the main protagonist has a “License To Kill” with his deadly elbows and human legs. His suit is always stained of red blood at the elbows and lower legs (this to help create an image that distinguish the two elements).	A midget driver trying to pass the road test to get their driver´s license. Their elbows are too short to turn the wheel and their legs are too short to reach the gas and breaks.	Names	1	イン	じょう、まこと.に、ゆるす	
828	tempt	Toa (xúi dục)	唆	tempt, mouth, streetwalker, Ministry of silly walks, John Cleese, license, elbow, human legs, walking legs	10	23	Mouth . . . license . . . walking legs.		I named the right part legal prostitute has it represents a walker [walking legs] with the license. It´s easy to imagine a legal prostitute tempting a man with her mouth.	Prostitutes in Amsterdam have a license to show off their walking legs and tempt customers with their mouths.	JH	1	サ	そそのか.す	唆す (そそのか.す)
829	exit	Xuất	出	exit	5	24	The kanji for exit pictures a series of mountain peaks coming out of the earth. Learn it together with the following frame.		Suddenly, a cactus comes out of the ground with a sign that reads: exit. Now you can leave the desert! (Note: giving this primitive the meaning ´cactus´ can be useful later).	The exit lays between these two mountains.	1	5	シュツ、スイ	で.る、-で、だ.す、-だ.す、い.でる、い.だす	出入 (しゅつにゅう), 出現 (しゅつげん), 提出 (ていしゅつ), 出す (だ.す), 出る (で.る)
830	mountain	San, sơn	山	mountain	3	24	Note the clearer outline of a triangular mountain here.		Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a mountain often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the mountain (see FRAME 775 for an example).	YOU CAN´T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!	1	5	サン、セン	やま	山 (やま)
831	bungling	Chuyết (vụng về, dờ)	拙	bungling, finger, fingers, exit	8	24	Fingers . . . exit.		With fingers fumbling around trying to get the key in the door so he could exit, the bungling husband woke his wife as he tried to leave for a rendezvous with his mistress.	Horror movie cliche 769: Bungling victim´s fingers fumble & bungle trying to open the exit door.	JH	1	セツ	つたな.い	
832	boulder	Nham (đá tảng, nham thạch)	岩	boulder, mountain, stone, rock	8	24	Mountain . . . rock.		A mountain-sized stone is known as a boulder.	Here we see mountain rocks rolling down the mountain, gathering into a single monstrous boulder crushing everything in its path. Think snowball effect, even if it wouldn´t work with rocks.	2	2	ガン	いわ	岩 (いわ)
833	charcoal	Thán (than)	炭	charcoal, mountain, ashes, cliff, fire	9	24	Mountain . . . ashes.		Burn enough charcoal and you´ll have a mountain of ash.	"You get charcoal from volcano (""fire mountain"", 火山) ashes."	3	2	タン	すみ	炭 (すみ)
834	branch off	Kì (đường núi, đường rẽ)	岐	branch off, mountain, branch, ten, needle, crotch	7	24	Mountains . . . branch.		On the left, there are three mountains. The road branches off to each of them. (Note: This kanji is mostly used for branches in the road).	In a lot of Super Nintendo-era RPGs, there are mountain levels to get through. You view them from overhead, so you can see a mazelike path with many branches. Picture your sprite characters at one such fork in the mountain path, as it branches off in two directions.	JH	1	キ、ギ		
835	mountain pass	Đèo	峠	mountain peak, mountain, above, below	9	24	Mountain . . . above . . . below.		Heisig mentions at kanjiclinic.com that he wishes he´d chosen mountain pass for this keyword as it´s closer to what the word means. If we do this, the kanji makes complete sense because a mountain pass is just below the mountain top.	"To the north of Lorien lies the Misty Mountains, and below their towering peaks are the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring first tried for the MOUNTAIN PASS that goes above, but were halted by the wizardry of Saruman at Caradhras, and so are forced to take the MOUNTAIN PASS that goes below, through the mountain - a path long feared by Gandalf for the ancient evil that lurks there. Note : the kanji does in fact refer to a ""mountain pass""."	JH	1		とうげ	峠 (とうげ)
836	crumble	Băng (hỏng, mất, băng hoại, băng hà)	崩	crumble, mountain, companion, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, moon2, month2, flesh2, part of the body2	11	24	Mountain . . . companion.		Sam and Frodo were steadfast companions even as Mount Doom crumbled above them.	September 11. [lol it also has 11 strokes], whoever reported this story is a loser, get alife. This is the best story on the website.	JH	1	ホウ	くず.れる、-くず.れ、くず.す	崩す (くず.す), 崩れる (くず.れる)
837	secrecy	Mật	密	secrecy, house, invariably, heart, mountain	11	24	House . . . invariably . . . mountain.		To maintain secrecy, secret societies invariably have to house themselves in the moutains.	To maintain secrecy, secret societies invariably have to house themselves on top of the moutains. (Slight tweak of chamcham´s story, using fuaburisa´s idea for remembering where to put the mountain primitive.).	6	1	ミツ	ひそ.か	
838	honey	Mật	蜜	honey, house, invariably, heart, insect	12	24	House . . . invariably . . . insect.		When I think of honey, I think of a bee hive, which is a HOUSE that INVARIABLY has INSECTS.	A house with a lot of honey will invariably attract many insects.	JH		ミツ、ビツ		
839	storm	Lam (hơi núi, bão tố)	嵐	storm, mountain, wind, gnats, drop, insect	12	24	Mountain . . . winds.		Storm is a full-blown wind that rips the mountains off the ground (you see one flying here).	Winds are gathering at the base of the mountain (note the hint to primitive placement), going up, and turning into a huge mountain storm.	JH	1	ラン	あらし	嵐 (あらし)
840	promontory	Kỳ (mũi đất)	崎	promontory, mountain, strange, large, St. Bernard, can, street, nail, spike, mouth	11	24	Mountain . . . strange. Hint: you might save yourself the trouble of a story here simply by recalling the kanji for cape (Frame 164) and toying around with the differing images suggested by the key words promontory and cape.		This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with mountain in place of soil. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives stone and strange. The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations. They have very little uses other than names, for which promontory is the clear winner with over 2300 uses in place and people names, while the other two kanjis account for less than 200 names.	A promontory is a small, strange mountain that juts out into the sea.	JH	1	キ	さき、さい、みさき	崎 (さき)
842	enter	Nhập	入	enter	2	24	"This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to enter someplace. Since the ""in"" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character."	* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: to go in, to put in, to come in, and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for umbrella, the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for eight. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.	Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.	Person enters stage left…　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ニュウ　入院　にゅういん(admittance into a hospital).	1	5	ニュウ、ジュ	い.る、-い.る、-い.り、い.れる、-い.れ、はい.る	入る (い.る), 入れる (い.れる), 入る (はい.る)
843	crowded	Nhập (chen chúc)	込	crowded, enter, road	5	24	Enter . . . road.		During a traffic jam it is impossible to get your car to enter the roadway as it is crowded with cars. Think of a grid lock so bad cars are litterally scraping up against each other like people on a Japanese train during rush hour.	Everybody tries to enter the road during rush hour. That´s why it´s so crowded.	JH	3		こ.み、 -こ.み、 -こ.む、 こ.む、 こ.める	込む (こ.む), 込める (こ.める)
844	part	Phân (chia ra)	分	part, eight, sword, dagger	4	24	Go in . . . dagger.		When something is entered by a dagger, it ends up being cut in several parts.	"(This kanji also has the meanings of ""understand"" and ""minute""). It´s important to understand that were you to enter an hour with a dagger and cut it into parts, those parts would be minutes."	2		ブン、フン、ブ	わ.ける、わ.け、わ.かれる、わ.かる、わ.かつ	分解 (ぶんかい), 自分 (じぶん), 水分 (すいぶん), 分別 (ふんべつ), 分銅 (ふんどう), 三十分 (さんじゅうふん), 分かつ (わ.かつ), 分かる (わ.かる), 分かれる (わ.かれる), 分ける (わ.ける)
845	poverty	Bần (bần cùng)	貧	poverty, part, eight, sword, dagger, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	11	24	Part . . . shells/money.		In the case of true poverty, not having money is only part of the problem. There are other components as well, like lack of education, class structuring, etc., but that doesn´t really matter. Just remember that the money is only part of it, not the whole.	Parting with your money will lead to poverty.	5	3	ヒン、ビン	まず.しい	貧富 (ひんぷ), 貧弱 (ひんじゃく), 清貧 (せいひん), 貧しい (まず.しい)
846	partition	Ban (ban bố)	頒	partition, part, eight, sword, dagger, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	13	24	Part . . . head.		The PART of my HEAD where I remember the KANJI is in the kanji PARTITION.	The last time I tried to partition a hard drive under Linux, I got a severe migraine that parted my head.	JH	1	ハン	わか.つ	
847	public	Công	公	public, eight, elbow	4	24	Come in . . . elbows. Use the key word in its adjectival sense, not as a noun.		I always open the doors to the public restrooms with my elbows because I don´t want to touch the door with my hands.	I always enter the doors to the public restrooms with my elbows because I don´t want to touch the door with my hands.	2	4	コウ、ク	おおやけ	公 (おおやけ)
848	pine tree	Tùng (cây tùng, cây thông)	松	pine tree, tree, wood, public, eight, elbows	8	24	Tree . . . public.		"Following up with the ""entering public restrooms"" story for the right-hand primitive: public restrooms always reek of pine tree scented disinfectant."	A pine tree is a public tree: they are frequently planted in public squares, in commemoration of the respect Conficius held for them.	4	1	ショウ	まつ	松 (まつ)
849	venerable old man	Ông	翁	venerable old man, public, eight, elbows, feathers, wings	10	24	Public . . . feathers.		The venerable old man is the public figure head of the Native American Village, answering all questions and solving all problems. The higher in rank you get in this tribe, the more feathers decorate you. Imagine this old man covered in beautiful feathers.	The venerable old man is using the public restroom in the park where he feeds the pigeons. But, alas, there is no toilet paper! So, he´s caught a pigeon and is using it to wipe his bottom. (note the feathers on the bottom of the kanji, this helps remember placement). Can you see the feathers flying everywhere?	JH	1	オウ	おきな	
850	sue	Tụng (tố tụng)	訟	sue, say, words, keitai, mouth, public, eight, elbows	11	24	Words . . . public.		Take care what words you say in public lest you be sued.	[+radical_tyro] Socrates was giving a speech in public. Things were going rather well, until his robe opened a bit and people saw his, well, not-public area. He was promptly sued for public indecency. Certain things shouldn´t be made public in public, you know?	JH	1	ショウ		
851	valley	Cốc (thung lũng)	谷	valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	7	24	Go in . . . an umbrella . . . a mouth. Because of space restrictions, the element for go in is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a valley stands out more clearly: the mouth of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way.		This could be seen as a very accurate pictograph of another type of valley: a valley mouth open under the umbrella of inner labia, with the outer labia parted above. There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will enter no further...	Think of the classic anime 風の谷のナウシカ (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind). We see Nausicaa entering the valley mouth gliding on an umbrella.	2	2	コク	たに、きわ.まる	谷 (たに)
852	bathe	Dục (tắm)	浴	bathe, water, water droplets, water pistol, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	10	24	Water . . . valley.		This story is quite lascivious, sorry... Now, imagine you are at a 混浴　（こんよく） [two kanjis we now know] Onsen (温泉), and you are watching a woman bathe. Just picture the water dripping down her cleavage (that valley in between her breasts). Note: cleavage in Japanese is 谷間.	The mountain man uses the water from the valley to bathe.	4	2	ヨク	あ.びる、あ.びせる	浴びせる (あ.びせる), 浴びる (あ.びる)
853	contain	Dung (dung mạo, nội dung)	容	contain, house, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	10	24	This character depicts a house so large that it can contain an entire valley.		Imagine a house big enough to contain an entire valley. might want to live there. And now imagine cleaning it. . . . Maybe not . . .	Biodome.	5	3	ヨウ	い.れる	
854	melt	Dung (dung dịch)	溶	melt, water, water droplets, water pistol, contents, contain, house, valley, animal legs, eight, umbrella, mouth	13	24	Water . . . contain.		Think of what happens when the snow on top of the mountains melts: it turns into water and flows down onto the rooftops of all the houses in the valley below.	[melt; dissolve; thaw] An ice cube is melting, loosing the water it contained.	JH	2	ヨウ	と.ける、と.かす、と.く	溶かす (と.かす), 溶く (と.く), 溶ける (と.ける)
855	longing	Dục (dục vọng, ham muốn)	欲	longing, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth, lack, yawn	11	24	Valley . . . yawn. Be sure to keep the key word distinct from pining (Frame 683).		Guess what? Japanese has dirty words too! (In fact, a lot of them) A sexual story is NOT inappropriate here, as this kanji is very sexual, such as in 性欲; lust. As for a story: the lack of contact with a woman´s valley will leave a man LONGING for love.	The valley has something my life is lacking.... something I´ve been longing for.. peace and quiet.	6	3	ヨク	ほっ.する、ほ.しい	欲しい (ほ.しい), 欲する (ほっ.する)
856	abundant	Dụ (giàu sang)	裕	abundant, cloak, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	12	24	This character shows the typical cloak of valley folk, which, unlike the tailor-made, high-fashion overcoats of city folk, is loose-fitting and free-form. Hence the key word's meaning of abundant.		"Again using the fact that cleavage in Japanese is called ""valley of the chest"": a woman with abundant cleavage tightly wraps up her bosom in a form-fitting cloak, but leaving her valley exposed. Another unforgettable image (thank you, thank you, I´ll be here all week)."	Welcome to cloak-valley, the valley where everyone wears cloaks and every shop sells cloaks. Mnemonic : “cloaks are abundant in the valley”.	JH	1	ユウ		
857	lead (metal)	Duyên (chì)	鉛	lead, metal, gold, gully, eight, mouth	13	24	Metal . . . gully.		Picture the molten lead (the heavy metal) being discreetly drained out of the factory into a gully behind.	Lead -> Dental fillings -> Metal that enters the mouth to fill a hole in a tooth.	JH	1	エン	なまり	鉛 (なまり)
858	run alongside	Duyên (ven, dọc theo)	沿	run alongside, water, water droplets, water pistol, gully, eight, mouth	8	24	Water . . . gully. The key word is meant to refer to things like rivers and railway tracks that run alongside something else.		Water in a gully runs alongside the path.	Picture one of those idiots that run alongside the bicyclists in the Tour de France trying to give them water. Watch as the cyclist shoves the person into a gully that runs alongside the road.	6	1	エン	そ.う、-ぞ.い	沿う (そ.う)
859	prize	Thưởng	賞	prize, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	15	25	Outhouse . . . shellfish.		This is a bit silly.. or maybe not only a bit, but.. You know some foodstuffs (cereals come to mind) sometimes have prizes mixed in them? Well, in this case, the prize was a shell (money, remember) and you only notice in the outhouse... (see also secret (#904)).	As a prize for being the 1,000,000th person to use the restaurant´s outhouse, I got all the clams I could eat.	4	2	ショウ	ほ.める	
860	party	Đảng	党	party, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, human legs	10	25	Think of this key word as referring to a political party, not a gala affair. Its elements: human legs . . . sticking out of an outhouse window.		Every major political party, if personified, would look like a giant outhouse walking around with human legs spewing out a constant stream of bullshit.	Every political party is full of shit. But nobody ever says how they get that way. Well, here´s your answer - a political party memer is in the outhouse, greedily chowing down on the contents inside. He´s grown so accustomed to the taste that he´s in all the way, and all you can see are his legs through the window. He´ll come inside later to the auditorium to make a speech and spew everything out.	6	2	トウ	なかま、むら	
861	hall	Đường ( thực đường, thiên đường)	堂	public chamber, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, soil, dirt, ground	11	25	Outhouse . . . land.		There is a secret hall buried in the soil underneath the outhouse.	In most communities you will be hauled into city hall if you use the ground as an outhouse.	4	4	ドウ		
862	usual	Thường	常	usual, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, towel	11	25	Outhouse . . . towel.		It´s usual to take your towel with you when you go to the outhouse at the onsen (hot springs bath in Japan) so everybody doesn´t see your stuff.	In the outhouse toilet you´d usually hope to find toilet paper to wipe your ass. If it´s already gone, which is usually the case, simply use the towel.	5	3	ジョウ	つね、とこ-	常 (つね), 常 (とこ)
863	skirt	Thường (váy dài)	裳	skirt, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	14	25	The key word refers to an ancient skirt once used as part of a woman's costume. The primitives you have to work with are: outhouse . . . garment.		Compared to pants, a SKIRT is the GARMENT to be wearing when you want to use one of those Japanese toilets. It makes it so much easier: you just walk in the OUTHOUSE hike it up, and do your business.	"Haven´t you ever noticed that the men / women signs on the front of outhouses are sometimes very similar? The silhouettes are usually the same, but one will decidedly be wearing a garment in the shape of a SKIRT. Also, we´ve already learned the kanji for ""woman"", so if the signs are only in kanji you have no right to wander in and claim ignorance, perv!"	Names		ショウ	も、もすそ	
864	manipulate	Chưởng (lòng bàn tay)	掌	manipulate, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, hand	12	25	Outhouse . . . hand.		If you´re going to manipulate your body with your hand, then go do it in an outhouse, at least!	Instead of magazines, we keep a Rubiks Cube in the outhouse to manipulate with your hands while you do your business.	JH	1	ショウ	てのひら、たなごころ	
865	pelt	Bì (da)	皮	pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	5	25	"The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for branch. The first stroke can then stand for something ""hanging"" down from the branch, namely its bark or pelt. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with."		A pelt is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a pelt and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging pelt) and the hook at the end of the second stroke. This is chinese radical #107 meaning “skin”.	"To be honest, this is one of those cases where I have found it easier to ""just remember it"" as a radical, as it occurs so frequently: 彼（かれ him）波（なみ wave）and so on."	3	2	ヒ	かわ、けがわ	皮 (かわ)
866	waves	Ba (sóng, phong ba)	波	waves, water, water droplets, water pistol, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	8	25	Water's . . . pelt.		Waves are the ocean´s pelt (skin).	The Inuit used water-proof seal pelts for their kayaks, to travel the waves.	3	2	ハ	なみ	波 (なみ)
867	old woman	Bà	婆	old woman, wave, water, water droplets, water pistol, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook, woman	11	25	Waves . . . woman.		An old woman is seen here as a woman with waves (i.e. wrinkles, creases).	"You know ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Well, this is the sequel, ""The Old Woman and the Sea Waves.""."	JH	1	バ	ばば、ばあ	
868	expose	Phi (mở ra)	披	expose, finger, fingers, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	8	25	Fingers . . . pelt.		You expose holes in a pelt by passing your fingers through them and wiggling them on the other side. The sense of the kanji here is to reveal something that was hidden, to make known, to open your heart (thus revealing it, exposing it to others), express your opinion, etc.	Think of it in this vulgar way. You really want her to expose her “beaver” pelt, so you have to encourage her with your fingers to expose it.	JH	1	ヒ		
869	rend	Phá	破	rend, stone, rock, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	10	25	Rock . . . pelt.		Before the invention of scissors or knives, sharp STONES were used to REND PELTs, so that caveman designers could complete new styles for the upcoming year.	Rend is a violent, primitive kind of word. (Image: cavemen rending pelts right off live animals with stone tools).	5	3	ハ	やぶ.る、やぶ.れる	破る (やぶ.る), 破れる (やぶ.れる)
870	incur	Bị	被	incur, cloak, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	10	25	Cloak . . . pelt.		If you wear a coat of fur (pelt) you are sure to incur the wrath of animal rights extremists.	A cloak of fur (pelt) will incur the wrath of animal lovers.	JH	2	ヒ	こうむ.る、おお.う、かぶ.る、かぶ.せる	被る (こうむ.る)
871	remainder	Tàn (tàn dư)	残	remainder, bones, one, ceiling, evening, float	10	25	Bones . . . (parade) float.		The remainder of the bones have been thrown from the float (for the dogs maybe, at the end of the parade).	Throwing all those coins (see coin (#368)) was a really bad idea; people got mad with greed. The only remainders left were the bones of those that was on the float.	4	3	ザン、サン	のこ.る、のこ.す、そこな.う、のこ.り	残す (のこ.す), 残る (のこ.る)
872	martyrdom	Tuân (chết vì đạo)	殉	martyrdom, bones, one, ceiling, evening, decameron, bound up, sun, day	10	25	Bones . . . decameron.		Think of the early Christian martyrs who suffered martyrdom because of their faith. See them held in cells for 10 days (a decameron) before being fed to the lions. They appear before the chanting Roman crowds as bones to be devoured. Think of what was leftover after the lions finished them off....nothing, not even a pile of bones to bury.	The boney man martyred himself during his 10 day hunger-strike.	JH	1	ジュン		
873	particularly	Thù (đặc thù)	殊	particularly, bones, one, ceiling, evening, vermilion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood	10	25	Bones . . . vermilion.		A t-bone steak is vermilion - particularly if served rare.	Castlevania -- The vermillion skeletons (bones) are particularly hard because they just keep regenerating.	JH	1	シュ	こと	殊 (こと)
874	augment	Thực (sinh sản, sinh)	殖	augment, bones, one, ceiling, evening, straightaway, ten, needle, eye, fishhook	12	25	Bones . . . straightaway.		Advertisement for Breast Implants -- Tired of nights all alone? Want to get boned straightaway? AUGMENT your breasts and all your troubles will be solved!	In the movie “Gattaca”, Vincent Freeman (played by Ethan Hawke) augments his size by straightening his bones (his legs), in order to match up with the genetically “perfect” population, and reach his goal of travelling in space. The stretching of his lower leg bones involved multiplying the bone cells, another sense of this key word.	JH	1	ショク	ふ.える、ふ.やす	殖える (ふ.える), 殖やす (ふ.やす)
875	file	Liệt (la liệt, hàng lối)	列	file, bones, one, ceiling, evening, sword, sabre, saber	6	25	Bones . . . saber. The sense of the key word is of people or things lined up in a row.		A line of skeletal warriors, all armed with sabers.	Skeleton army rank and file. Dudes made of bones carrying sabres.	3	3	レツ、レ		
876	split	Liệt (rách)	裂	split, file, bones, one, ceiling, evening, sword, sabre, saber, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	12	25	File . . . garment.		They tried issuing the skeleton warriors with proper garments to wear, but they kept getting split by the sharp bones or by their sabres. In the end, it was decided they look scarier naked anyway.	Someone takes a sword made of bone to split the garment right down the middle. Very effective.	JH	1	レツ	さ.く、さ.ける、-ぎ.れ	裂く (さ.く), 裂ける (さ.ける)
877	ardent	Liệt (mãnh liệt, cháy dữ)	烈	ardent, file, bones, one, ceiling, evening, sword, sabre, saber, oven-fire, barbecue	10	25	File . . . oven fire.		The nazis were ardent believers in the master arian race, see them marching everyone else into the oven fires, single file.	The undead, marching single file, prove how ardent they are be walking across a field of flame. Fun fact, ardent used to mean to burn.	JH	1	レツ	はげ.しい	
878	death	Tử	死	death, bones, one, ceiling, evening, spoon, sitting on the ground	6	25	"Bones . . . spoon. Note how the first stroke is extended to the right, forming a sort of ""roof"" overhead."		Ok, this is where knowing some Eastern culture comes in handy! In Japanese society, when someone dies they creamate the body and pick out the remaining bones with special chopsticks. In this case, they´re out of chopsticks so they decide to use (gasp!) a spoon instead.	Imagine the grim reaper (the bringer of death), carrying a spoon made of human bones instead of a scythe.	3	4	シ	し.ぬ、し.に-	死ぬ (し.ぬ)
879	interment	Táng (an táng, chôn)	葬	interment, flowers, death, bones, one, ceiling, evening, spoon, sitting on the ground, two hands	12	25	Flowers . . . death . . . two hands. Do not confuse with bury (Frame 191).		I imagine an interment as a funeral. At this funeral it´s an open casket, and the dead body (death) is holding flowers with both of its hands.	During the interment ceremony, the grandchildren placed flowers over the dead body while the widow sat praying with two hands.	JH	1	ソウ	ほうむ.る	葬る (ほうむ.る)

Imagine Snoopy winking with his big eyes (and a happy smile) standing next to Woodstocks Birdhouse, woodstock being so cool that he wears little sunglasses.	What a dilemna, you wore SUNGLASSES over your EYES when you went to the BIRDHOUSE so you wouldn´t be recognized - but now you can´t WINK at the girl you want!	JH	1	シュン	またた.く、まじろ.ぐ	瞬く (またた.く)
881	ear	Nhĩ	耳	ear	6	25	The pictograph for the ear looks much like that for eye, but note how the stroke order gives it a different look.		Your ear is like the eye on the side of your head for seeing things, but there is hair around it that creates jagged lines.	Pictograph, see book. * The primitive meaning can easily be extended to ear plugs.	1	3	ジ	みみ	耳 (みみ)
882	take	Thủ (lấy, nhận)	取	take, ear, crotch	8	25	Ear . . . crotch.		"You put your ear next to a womans crotch...and somehow, from it, you hear the words ""Take me....""."	Fuaburisu´s with a twist: You know that classic trick where someone pretends to take something out of an someone else´s ear (such as a coin). Instead of a cigarette or a pen he pulls the person’s crotch out of their ear. Very painful!	3	3	シュ	と.る、と.り、と.り-、とり、-ど.り	取る (と.る)
883	gist	Thú (hứng thú, thú vị)	趣	gist, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, take, ear, crotch	15	25	Run . . . take.		The gist of it is this: We take the money and run!	Pickpocket advice: It´s simple, FIRST run, then take. Yeah, that´s the gist of it!	JH	1	シュ	おもむき、おもむ.く	趣 (おもむき)
884	utmost	Tối (nhất, tối cao)	最	utmost, sun, day, take, ear, crotch	12	25	Sun . . . take.		TAKE the UTMOST care when you SUN bath all DAY, or you´ll get burned from your EARS to your CROTCH.	Do your utmost - seize(take) the day.	4	3	サイ、シュ	もっと.も、つま	最も (もっと.も)
885	snapshot	Toát (chụp ảnh)	撮	snapshot, finger, fingers, utmost, sun, day, take, ear, crotch	15	25	"Finger . . . utmost. This character is used for taking photographs. Note how, conveniently, the element for ""take"" is included in it."		Take the utmost care that you don´t have your finger in the way when you take a snapshot.	"When I learned photography from my dad as a little girl, he explained the basics to me: ""when you take a snapshot, be careful not to put your fingers before the lens, and don´t look towards the sun (this was in the days that photographs would be spoiled by direct sunlight)."

886	shame	Sỉ (xấu hổ, sỉ nhục)	恥	shame, ear, heart	10	25	Ear . . . heart. It is most rare to have the heart at the right, rather than at the bottom. Take advantage of this fact when you compose your story.		Amelia Ear-Heart (sic) brought shame to those who said women couldn´t fly.	Vincent Van Gogh´s greatest shame was cutting off his ear to win the heart of a woman.	JH	3	チ	は.じる、はじ、は.じらう、は.ずかしい	恥じらう (は.じらう), 恥じる (は.じる), 恥ずかしい (は.ずかしい), 恥 (はじ)
887	post	Chức (chức vụ, từ chức)	職	post, ear, kazoo, sound, vase, stand up, sun, day, fiesta	18	25	The key word refers to one's occupation, or position of employment. Its elements: ear . . . kazoo.		Worst post in history: quality checker at the kazoo factory. Imagine the toll on your ears!	Buckingham Palace guards are famous for staying at their post no matter what, even if you blow a kazoo in their ear!	5	3	ショク、ソク		
888	holy	Thánh	聖	holy, ear, mouth, king, jewel, ball	13	25	Ear . . . mouth . . . king.		A holy man hears with his ears before he speaks with his mouth, which places him higher than a king in people's esteem.	The trick for me is to remember that the 耳 is to the left of the 口. However, this is easy because a true holy man uses his ear to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his mouth to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up. Of course, kings are often true holy men and prophets (e.g., King David in the bible).	6	1	セイ、ショウ	ひじり	
889	daring	Cảm (dám, dũng cảm)	敢	daring, street, nail, spike, ear, taskmaster	12	25	Spike . . . ear . . . taskmaster.		Only a truly daring Japanese student would wear a spike in his ear under the gaze of the Japanese teacher taskmasters!	See that ear nailed over there ? It´s the ear of the last person who was too daring with the taskmistress.	JH	1	カン	あ.えて、あ.えない、あ.えず	
890	listen	Thính (thính giả)	聴	listen, ear, stethoscope, camel, ten, needle, eye, cross-eyed, net, heart	17	25	Ear . . . needle . . . eye . . . heart. Compare frame 427 for this and the following kanji, and then once again when you get to frame 950.		I promise to use my ear to do nothing but listen ... stick a needle in my eye, cross my heart and hope to die! (Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).	"Listening to others is different from hearing [1626] with the ear. One must allow the words to pierce through the eyes (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the heart...a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, ""You´re not listening to me, are you?"" He replies, ""I heard every word you said. You said..."" “Yes, but you´re not listening.""."	JH	1	チョウ、テイ	き.く、ゆる.す	聴く (き.く)

"(re: taijuando) When you are in New York City you have to be alert, i.e. in the ""New York State of Mind"": you need ten eyes to make sure no one will go through your garments and pick your pockets."	"Imagine Darth Vader´s state of mind when he discovers his garment has not pockets. "" D O NOT WANT!""."

"I´ll focus on the mandala primitive here. I guess Heisig chose this keyword for phonetic reasons and as a character it´s the ""man"" in mandara/mandala (曼荼羅). A mandala is a graphic representation of the universe, here split in 3 planes of existance, the sun representing the cosmos, the eye represents the human observer, the crotch represents the animal instincts."	He´ s often ridiculed for having his eye on crotches all day.	JH	1	マン		
893	loose	Mạn (tản mạn, buông tuồng, ko biết tự kiềm chế)	漫	loose, water, water droplets, water pistol, mandala, sun, day, eye, cross-eyed, net, crotch	14	25	Water . . . mandala.		One obscure Tibetan sect-- the Otaku cult-- has an unusually loose interpretation of mandala drawing practice. Instead of traditional mandalas they draw mangas (漫画). They then pour water on the image to wash it away, and begin anew.	Even NELSON MANDALA dreams of drops of WATER glistening on comic book/ anime girls with LOOSE morals. (This story has been edited in response reports).	JH	1	マン	みがりに	
894	buy	Mãi (mua, khuyến mãi)	買	buy, eye, cross-eyed, net, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	12	25	Eye . . . shellfish.		When something catches my eye, I take out a few clams and buy before anybody else does.	Rules to Buying: 1. You´ve had your eye on it for a while. 2. You have enough shells to afford it.	2	4	バイ	か.う	買う (か.う)
895	placement	Trí (bố trí)	置	placement, eye, cross-eyed, net, straightaway, ten, needle, eye, fishhook	13	25	Eye . . . straightaway.		On the JET Programme, many people have their eye on a placement in Tokyo, Osaka or another big city, and write it on their application form. They are usually sent to the countryside straightaway.	Working in retail you learn the placement of any item should be at eye level so it´s seen straightaway.	4	3	チ	お.く、-お.き	置く (お.く)
896	penalty	Phạt	罰	penalty, eye, cross-eyed, net, say, words, keitai, mouth, sword, sabre, saber	14	25	Eye . . . words . . . saber.		For Japanese, when the mind´s eye (the sideways eye) feels guilty for something bad that the body has done, there are two penaltys to choose from. One, you can say I´m sorry. Two, you can commit suicide by sabre. Why, oh why, do so many Japanese executives commit suicide at the first sign of scandal when all the have to do is say I´m sorry to get off the hook. (on yomi: バチ, バツ).	There is a 3-way masterplan for every goalkeeper to prevent a goal at penalty shootout: 1. Look directly into the eyes of the player --- 2. Confuse him by screaming senseless words --- 3. Pull out you your saber and ... (that´s up to you).	JH	1	バツ、バチ、ハツ	ばっ.する	罰金 (ばっきん), 処罰 (しょばつ), 天罰 (てんばつ)
897	rather	Ninh (thà, an ninh, yên ổn)	寧	rather, house, heart, eye, cross-eyed, net, street, nail, spike	14	25	House . . . heart . . . eye . . . spike.		Rather a house with a heart than an eye with a spike.	"A pretty tough kanji. Think of elegant old housewives with English accents dining together at a HOUSE party. The hostess brings out a dish of hors d´oeuvres: a SPIKE of metal with an EYEBALL and a HEART skewered on it. Upon being offered this treat, one of the housewives says in her English accent, ""I´d RATHER not.""."	JH	1	ネイ	むし.ろ	
898	voiced	Trọc (đục)	濁	voiced, water, water droplets, water pistol, spider, eye, cross-eyed, net, bound up, insect	16	25	"The key word for this kanji connotes the ""muddying"" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a ""j"" is voiced while a ""sh"" is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is voiced. The primitives are: water . . . eye . . . bound up . . . insect."		"The fly is wrapped in a spiderweb voicing ""Help me, Help Me"" under the watchful eye of the spider who´s venom is dripping like water from her fangs."	Pour water over the eyes of a bound up insect if you want to hear a pitiful buzz that is very similar to a VOICED consanant.	JH	1	ダク、ジョク	にご.る、にご.す	濁す (にご.す), 濁る (にご.る)
899	ring	Hoàn (cái vòng ngọc)	環	ring, king, jewel, ball, trampoline, eye, cross-eyed, net, one, ceiling, mouth, scarf	17	25	Jewel . . . eye . . . ceiling . . . mouth . . . scarf. The number of elements is large here, so take extra care. Learn it in conjunction with the next frame, since these are the only two cases in this book where the combination of elements to the right appears.		Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the ring”. First we have a jewel. Next we have the great eye of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many ceilings during their journey. The fourth and fifth primitives are the mouth of Gollum always mumbling “My preciousss”; and Pippin´s scarf! Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.	In conjunction with send back (#837)....... When I tried to give her the jewel ring, she eyed me, threw it to the floor, opened her mouth and tried to speak, she said nothing. She grabbed her scarf and left.	JH	1	カン	わ	
900	send back	Hoàn (hoàn trả)	還	send back, trampoline, eye, cross-eyed, net, one, ceiling, mouth, scarf, road	16	25	Road . . . eye . . . ceiling . . . mouth . . . scarf.		You´ve probably guessed it by now, this is the road that Sam and Frodo take to send back the ring to Mount Doom! (see previous frame, the jewel is replaced by the road).	Continued from ring (#836)....... So I´m on the road going to send back the ring minus the jewel, the hit to the floor knocked it out.	JH	1	カン	かえ.る	
901	husband	Phu	夫	husband, husband, one, large	4	25	"The kanji for a husband or ""head of the family"" is based on the kanji for large and an extra line near the top for the ""head."" Recall the kanji for heavens already learned back in frame 457, and be sure to keep your story for this kanji different."		Even though it is argued size is not important, I´m sure most women would like their husband to have a big one.	Homer Simpson, as a primitive.	4	3	フ、フウ、ブ	おっと、そ.れ	夫妻 (ふさい), 農夫 (のうふ), 凡夫 (ぼんおっと), 夫 (おっと)
902	aid	Phù (phù hộ, phù trợ)	扶	aid, finger, fingers, husband	7	25	Fingers . . . husband.		Using his finger the husband sometimes is an erotic aid to his partner.	In Homer Simpsons´ house, the first aid kit is usually used for when he smashes his fingers trying to build something (there are countless Simpsons episodes you can draw from for this).	JH	1	フ	たす.ける	
903	mountain stream	Khê (thung lũng, khê cốc)	渓	mountain stream, water, water droplets, water pistol, claw, vulture, husband	11	25	Water . . . vulture . . . husband.		The Simpsons are on vacation. Homer stops to take a leak in a mountain stream but gets snatched by an eagle. Hear his scream?	A husband who went fishing at the mountain stream to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we´ll assume this is a large mountain stream). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in chicken (#1947).	JH	1	ケイ	たに、たにがわ	
904	standard	Quy (qui tắc, qui luật)	規	standard, husband, see, telescope, eye, human legs	11	25	Husband . . . see.		In the male-dominated world of yesterday, the husband´s way of seeing things was considered the standard point of view. Women who dared to disagree were frowned upon.	Unfortunately, Homer Simpson is the standard model of a husband in American society. (Placement: You have to look in the RIGHT places to find one that doesn´t fit that mold.).	5	3	キ		
905	exchange	Thế (thay thế)	替	exchange, husband, sun, day, tongue wagging, husband2	12	25	Two husbands . . . day.		"A show like ""Trading Spouses"" called ""exchanging husbands"" where 2 husbands are exchanged for a day (thanks dingomick)."	Marge´s dream: to exchange Homer for another husband for just one day.

907	submerge	Tiềm (tiềm ẩn, tiềm thức)	潜	submerge, water, water droplets, water pistol, exchange, husband, sun, day, tongue wagging, husband2	15	25	Water . . . exchange.		When a submarine or similar vessel SUBMERGES an EXCHANGE of air for WATER takes place in special compartments.	The two husbands exchange for a day on the reality TV show (see exchange (#842)) finally goes underway. One of the two husband´s first job is to fix the water faucet in his new family´s apartment.

908	lose	Thất (thấp nghiệp)	失	lose, drop, husband	5	25	"""To lose"" here takes the sense of ""misplace,"" not the sense of defeat, whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a husband with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he loses."	* As a primitive, this character can also mean to drop.	The drop falling here is the husband´s toupee... he´s already lost his hair once, now he´s losing it again. Such is life, I suppose.	Note: Heisig´s stroke order is wrong. It´s the same as vermilion, drop first. Homer loses/drops his wedding ring.	4	3	シツ	うしな.う、う.せる	失う (うしな.う)
909	iron	Thiết (sắt)	鉄	iron, metal, gold, lose, drop, husband	13	25	Metal . . . to drop.		Iron is a metal that gradually becomes lost due to oxidation and rust.	Compare with pig-iron (#270). In moving from pig-iron to iron, some of the metal´s maleability is LOST. (The only difference between the two kanji is that IRON has knee-less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.).	3	2	テツ	くろがね	
910	alternate	Điệt (luân phiên, đắp đổi)	迭	transfer, alternate, lose, drop, husband, road	8	25	To drop . . . road.		When you get lost, you just take an alternate road to get back on track.	When you lose your way, you can always try to tell the wife that you merely took an alternate road. To save time you know. I´m not LOST, I´m just taking an alternate road. Ahem.	JH	1	テツ		
911	retainer	Thần (bầy tôi, trung thần)	臣	retainer, slave	7	25	"This kanji is actually a pictograph for an eye, distorted to make it appear that the pupil is protruding towards the right. This may not be an easy form to remember, but try this: Draw it once rather large, and notice how moving the two vertical lines on the right as far right as possible gives you the pictograph of the eye in its natural form. The ""pop-eye"" image belongs to an Emperor's retainer standing in awe before his ruler."	* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word becomes slave.	Its a pictograph of a teeth with a retainer in the middle.	Retainer = A slave (for the purposes of this kanji.) This is a pictograph of a slave collar with two handcuffs dangling from it.	4	2	シン、ジン		臣下 (しんか), 君臣 (くんしん)
912	princess	Cơ (công chúa)	姫	princess, woman, retainer, slave	10	25	Woman . . . slave.		Princess Leia becomes Jabba´s slave (“princess Leia is a woman slave”).	Cinderella: A woman who was a slave who became a princess.	JH	1	キ	ひめ、ひめ-	姫 (ひめ)

The slaves are to be sold in the store, to differentiate from a warehouse, which doesn´t have the word ""store"" in it."

You signed your organ donor card, right? So, when you die, your entrails and other body parts will be placed in a storehouse.	Again with the Pyramids, each Pharaoh had their entrails taken out and put into little jars that were shaped in the forms of their Gods and entombed along with the preserved body. So, the entrails are the parts of the body that are placed in the storehouse along with the Pharaoh! Damnit, why can´t they always be this easy? :(.	6	2	ゾウ	はらわた	
915	intelligent	Hiền (hiền nhân)	賢	intelligent, loincloth, retainer, slave, crotch, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	16	25	Slave . . . crotch . . . shellfish.		An intelligent man is neither slave to his crotch nor to money. But an intelligent slave will know how to use his/her crotch to make money.	Every intelligent man is a slave to two things, his: 1) crotch, and 2) money.	JH	2	ケン	かしこ.い	賢い (かしこ.い)

The key word suggests both looking ahead to something and ""seeing to"" what is at hand. Consistent with everything we have learned about the role of the key word, this means that you must choose ONE meaning and stick to it."		"The slave is look to the future, ""One day"" he thinks ""I will be able to recline with all my goods, a tv, stereo and washing machine, and when that day comes I shall be truly happy"" he sighs."	"Imagine a slave(or in this case, a female porn star) looking to her new gangbang film where she reclines and gets all 3 holes filled at the same...........OK.

920	gigantic	Cự (to lớn)	巨	gigantic, Fafner	5	25	"This kanji depicts a gigantic ""pop-eye,"" which accounts for its shape. Be sure not to confuse it with the slave (retainer) we just learned."		This is actually the top view of a porn star with a gigantic erect penis. The top and bottom are his arms and the middle is his penis. Imagine him making the pumping motion while he´s banging some chick. The arms move in, the penis moves out and vice versa.	The letter E, with a GIGANTIC middle stroke.	JH	2	キョ		
921	repel	Cự (cự tuyệt, chống cự)	拒	repel, finger, fingers, gigantic, Fafner	8	25	Fingers . . . gigantic.		A woman might be REPELLED by a porn star´s GIGANTIC penis, so he kindly offers to use his FINGERS instead.	Having gigantic fingers is useful to repel insects. You can swat them away a lot easier!	JH	1	キョ、ゴ	こば.む	拒む (こば.む)
922	power	Lực (sức lực)	力	power, muscle, arnold	2	25	With a little imagination, one can see a muscle in this simple, two-stroke character meaning power.	* As a primitive, either muscle or power can be used.	"I always refer to the power of the KATAKANA ""KA""."	I have a very powerful muscle カ in my driveway!	1	4	リョク、リキ、リイ	ちから	権力 (けんりょく), 努力 (どりょく), 能力 (のうりょく), 力 (ちから)
923	man	Nam	男	male, rice field, brains, power, muscle, arnold	7	25	Rice fields . . . power. This character is the gender-specific man, not the generic human person of frame 951.		Male is seen here as muscles working in the field, in other words working in the rice fields is the work of the male who are usually stronger. This is more or less the meaning of the original Chinese character.	When it comes to choosing a MAN, I prefer brains over muscles.	1	5	ダン、ナン	おとこ、お	男子 (だんし), 男女 (だんじょ), 男性 (だんせい), 男 (おとこ)
924	labor	Lao (lao động)	労	labor, schoolhouse, owl, crown, power, muscle, arnold	7	25	Schoolhouse . . . power.

The necromancer hangs out at the local graveyard and uses his dark powers to recruit an army of undead. Emphasize the verb form to keep distinct from the noun cadet (#1173).

926	inferiority	Liệt (thua kém)	劣	inferiority, few, power, muscle, arnold	6	25	Few . . . muscles.		I have an inferiority complex because I have fewer muscles than everyone else at the gym. They all look like Macho Man Randy Savage (power) to me.	I had trouble remembering the relative position of the components, so now I use this story: Even muscular men have inferiority if they have few things above their muscles (i.e., brain cells).	JH	1	レツ	おと.る	劣る (おと.る)
927	achievement	Công (công trạng)	功	achievement, craft, powered, power, muscle, arnold	5	25	Craft . . . power.

I think of the hippogriff from Harry Potter as being like a pegasus. To befriend a hippogriff, you have to persuade it you mean no harm, you can do this if you have ""pegasus persuasion power""."	It would take a powerful argument to persuade me Pegasus was real… RTK2:　カン　勧奨　かんしょう(encouragement)… 　　　　　　　　Semi-Pure Group:　歓570　観572 　(ｹﾝ): 権571.	JH	1	カン、ケン	すす.める	勧める (すす.める)

932	add	Gia (phụ gia)	加	add, power, muscle, arnold, mouth	5	25	Muscles . . . mouth. This is the only case in which the primitive for muscle appears on the left; note should be taken of the fact in composing one's story.		If you eat anymore, you will be adding more カロries.

Hint: if you ever played with an ""Erector Set"" or ""Tinker Toys"" as a child, don't pass up the opportunity to relate it to this kanji's key word and the element for trees."		Instant wood. Just add Viagra.	I´m not sure I know about erector sets or tinker toys but I do know about jenga. You play by taking wooden pieces from the middle of a wooden tower and adding them to the top. In this way you erect a very unstable structure.	JH	1	カ	か.ける、か.かる	架かる (か.かる), 架ける (か.ける)
935	armpit (cách khác, chỗ khác)	Hiếp	脇	armpit, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, triceps, power, muscle, arnold, power3, muscle3, arnold3	10	25	"Part of the body . . . muscles (three of which give us ""triceps"" or ""muscles on top of muscles""). You will want to keep the kanji distinct from the one that follows by paying attention to the positioning of the elements."		What part of the body has a very, very, very powerful smell? The armpit, of course!	(no important on yomi) The part of Conan´s body that is three times more effective at defeating foes than his muscles are his stinky ARMPITs. [Note: Typically, when the flesh primitive is on the left side it refers to a body part - this helps distinguish in from threaten (#871)].	JH		キョウ	わき、わけ	脇 (わき)

Compare the primitive positions of armpit (#870) and threaten (#871). When your triceps rest alongside your body, they fit snugly against your armpit. When you hold them above your body, however, your posture becomes quite threatening.	Don´t threaten a warewolf. He´s three times as powerful ON a full moon.　RTK2:　キョウ　脅迫　きょうはく (blackmail)…　Pure Group:　協872.	JH	1	キョウ	おびや.かす、おど.す、おど.かす	脅かす (おど.かす), 脅す (おど.す), 脅かす (おびや.かす)

Co-operation: 3 persons can have the power of ten if they co-operate.	4	2	キョウ		
938	going	Hành	行	going, boulevard, going	6	25	By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for going.	* As a primitive, this character has two forms. Reduced to the left side only, it can mean a column, going, or a line of something or other. When the middle is opened up to make room for other elements, it means a boulevard.	I use The Flash for for this primitive; a superhero who is always going very fast.	To me, this looks like a bridge going over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and going constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity. You can see that arc here.	2	5	コウ、ギョウ、アン	い.く、ゆ.く、-ゆ.き、-ゆき、-い.き、-いき、おこな.う、おこ.なう	行進 (こうしん), 行為 (こうい), 旅行 (りょこう), 行列 (ぎょうれつ), 行政 (ぎょうせい), 修行 (しゅぎょう), 行く (い.く), 行う (おこな.う), 行く (ゆ.く)
939	rhythm	Luật (luật pháp)	律	rhythm, Nelson, column, going, line, brush	9	25	This character depicts a calligrapher's brush and its rhythmic sway as it flows down a column writing kanji on the way.		The calligrapher´s brush is moving down a column of a script, in rhythm with his meditation.	The army COLUMN walked to the RHYTHM made by the drummer using a cool BRUSH like drum stick. Picturing the brush as a drum stick is not difficult if you´ve seen such a thing in jazz videos.	6	2	リツ、リチ、レツ		律動 (りつどう), 規律 (きりつ), 法律 (ほうりつ)
940	restore	Phục (phục hồi)	復	restore, Nelson, column, going, line, fold back, double back, reclining, lying down, sun, day, walking legs	12	25	Going . . . double back.		Before going all the way to the Boss in a Final Fantasy game, you should probably double back to save at a restore point.	The column of soldiers has to double back to restore the peace in the village they just left.	5	2	フク	また	
941	gain	Đắc (đắc lợi)	得	gain, Nelson, column, going, line, bill posters, nightbreak, sun, day, one, floor, glue	11	25	Column . . . nightbreak . . . glue.		To gain more knowledge of what´s goin on in the world I´m reading column after column of articles in the newspapers, and it takes so much time I´m glued to it till nightbreak.	Imagine fat people......they avoid going outside to exercise and stay glued to their TV set until nightbreak....so of course they gain weight.	4	3	トク	え.る、う.る	得る (う.る), 得る (え.る)

945	journey	Vãng (đi, dĩ vãng)	往	journey, Nelson, column, going, line, candlestick, lord, drop, king, jewel, ball	8	25	Column . . . candlestick. This character has the special sense of journeying to someplace or other.		Parties should stay in a single-file line and carry a candlestick while journeying through an unknown dungeon in an RPG.

947	diameter	Kính (bán kính)	径	diameter, Nelson, column, going, line, spool, clod, toilet paper, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	8	25	Line . . . spool.		Scientists recently measured the diameter of Earth by drilling a deep hole and dropping a line of thread off a humongous spool until it got to the other side.	"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) Toilet paper/roll usually comes on a spool. (2) Toilet paper is used to clean the soil off your crotch. Story: Measure the diameter of a column (maybe Nelson´s Column in London?) using a roll of toilet paper. Spool also appears in stalk (#715), suspicious (#716), lightly (#717), sutra (#1360)."	4	1	ケイ	みち、こみち、さしわたし、ただちに	
948	he	Bỉ (anh ta)	彼	he, Nelson, column, going, line, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	8	25	Going . . . pelt. This kanji refers to the third person singular personal pronoun, generally in its masculine form.		What´s the main difference between a he and a she? The he has a column covered in a pelt... a penis. Badum-ching.	The ultimate he-man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar (column), and he wears a ragged pelt as his only clothing.

Refer back now to the note in frame 890.		Hearkening back to the kanji for LISTEN... Benevolence is a good listener who is willing to go the distance to help.

"Penal servitude is served until indications show that one has had a change of heart (learned one´s lesson). Easily confused with punish (#679) and penalty (#833). Concentrate on the reasons behind the penal system (""changing people´s hearts"" here), instead of the penalty itself or the punishment (revenge) aspect. It may help to note that there´s no sword, but a heart :-) (Note: 懲りる = learn from one´s bad experiences)."	Judge: You will serve a penal sentence until indications show you have a heart.

957	equilibrium	Hành (cái cân)	衡	equilibrium, boulevard, going, bound up, rice field, brains, large, St. Bernard	16	25	Boulevard . . . bound up . . . brains . . . St. Bernard dog.		To maintain the social equilibrium in a future dystopian society, the brains of citizens are bound up (hypnotized). The government is using mental wave emitting statues shaped like St. Bernard´s dogs put alongside the boulevards.	I think BALANCE is an easier keyword. I was walking down a busy French boulevard when between the rushing traffic I saw the wierdest thing. BALANCING on the central crash barrier was a St. Bernard dog, BALANCING a fish on its nose. As I looked closer, I realised it was a trick; it was holding the fish´s tail in its teeth, and only pretending to BALANCE it. (keeps the position of the elements!).	JH	1	コウ

The extent to which some people will go to create ´wheat displays´, or as some call them ´crop circles´, is truly amazing.	The wheat crop has come in, and the mouth of the king is gobbling it all up.

Nobody likes the tax man, so here it is only fitting that the person who comes over to take some of your wheat is depicted here as a devil. Keep in mind that in feudal societies there was no kind of money to speak of, so taxes were paid by serfs in wheat to the devils who came over to keep them poor.	This is an easy one.

968	private	Tư	私	private, wheat, cereal, elbow	7	26	Wheat . . . elbow. Like the characters for I (Frame 17) and ego (Frame 690), this kanji is also representative of the subject, with the special connotation of privacy.		"Warning sign: ""Private wheat, trespassers will be elbowed""."	"I already know this as watashi, or ""I"". In order to associate the keyword of private, I´ll think of this one as ""Private I"", like a detective."	6	4	シ	わたくし、わたし	私 (わたくし)

975	ear of a plant	Tuệ (tai)	穂	ear (of a plant), wheat, cereal, favour, favor, ten, needle, rice field, brains, heart	15	26	Wheat . . . favor.		The pilgrims only had wheat, so they asked the Indians to do them a favor and trade them for some ears of corn.	"The ""ear of a plant"" is the seed-bearing spike of a cereal plant, such as corn. In other words, it is the part which feeds us. Hence -- ""the ear (of a plant) is the favor of the wheat""."	JH	1	スイ	ほ	穂 (ほ)
976	rice plant	Đạo (cây lúa)	稲	rice plant, wheat, cereal, claw, vulture, old days, olden times, stick, sun, day	14	26	Wheat . . . vulture . . . olden times.		The rice plant is common in Japan because all the wheat was eaten by vultures in the olden times.	It used to be that wheat was grown in Japan. However, this was often stolen by vultures, so in olden times, the gods gave the Japanese the rice plant.	JH	1	トウ、テ	いね、いな-	稲 (いね)
977	incense	Hương	香	incense, wheat, cereal, sun, day	9	26	Wheat . . . sun.		If you focus the suns though a magnifying glass on to the bottom of a stalk of wheat it will start to smoulder and burn like a stick of incense. The weird thing is that it burns from the bottom upwards, hanging in the air as if my magic. Try it and see!	When the sun burns the wheat a smell of incense remains in the air.

You spend three hours putting all of your wheat sale transaction records into Microsoft Excel, when suddenly it crashes, so you put your fist through the monitor.

If you excel in the Mario Kart road, your movements are saved and you can race against yourself as a transparent racer. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe8CkcrL-k4.	If you want to excel at driving in the roadway, it´s better if your windows and windshield are transparent. Picture the drivers with opaque windshields all wrecked on the side of the road.

985	germ	Khuẩn	菌	germ, flowers, pent in, wheat, cereal	11	26	Flowers . . . pent in . . . wheat.		Can also mean bacteria.....imagine the wheat pent in your fridge growing to the point where they resemble flowers.......I actually had something similar happen to onions...they grew footlong legs after about 2 or 3 years......OR just think of that Cowboy Bebop episode with the lobster in the fridge... :-).	Actually it means germs as in microorganisms. So for example, you have to keep wheat enclosed so it isn´t exposed to other plants. That way it can´t catch any germs (like fungi) from them.	JH	1	キン		
987	rice	Mê (gạo)	米	rice	6	26	This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of rice lying on a plate in the shape of a star.	* As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of rice, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for wheat that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of rice far exceeds that of wheat.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to grains of rice. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for water. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, grains of rice has 5 strokes, while water only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for rice is an abbreviation used for the United States, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.	Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the rice. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.	Two drops of rice in a tree, simple.	2	3	ベイ、マイ、メエトル	こめ、よね	米作 (べいさく), 米価 (べいか), 米食 (べいしょく), 米 (こめ)

"Imagine Japanese army provisions like obentou boxes, always containing the same quantity of rice. (thanks darg_sama, emphasizing quantity and the nuance of food ""rations"", ""food supply"": the kanji also appears in ""military provisions"" and ""army rice"")."

Notice that the horizontal line of the bottom primitive doubles up as the final stroke for pent in.		In the core of a nuclear reactor, scientists have discovered a way to get power from rice, by penting it in under high pressure. It´s very dangerous, so they´ve trained a st. bernard dog to run things, he´s adding more drops of rice as necessary.	"奥さん　（おくさん) is a common way to say ""wife"". In the innermost core of the house, the bored pent up housewife drops her chores and consumes so much rice she becomes a very large housewife."	JH	2	オウ、オク	おく.まる、くま	奥 (おく)

1001	lacquer	Tất (sơn)	漆	lacquer, water, water droplets, water pistol, tree, wood, umbrella, grains of rice	14	26	Water . . . tree . . . umbrella . . . grains of rice.		LACQUER is a type of WATERY type of liquid used to protect items made from TREES, sort of an UMBRELLA of protection. So protective, you can carry around RICE in the LACQUERED, WOODEN product.	Water is falling from a tree onto the umbrella underneath which is protecting the rice underneath it. But it´s completely dry since the umbrella is lacquered.	JH	1	シツ	うるし	漆 (うるし)
1003	Esq.	Dạng (đa dạng, hình dạng)	様	Esq., tree, wood, sheep, grains of rice	14	26	The abbreviation Esq. will help associate this character with the honorific form of address to which it belongs. Its elements are: tree . . . sheep . . . grains of rice. Note that the final vertical stroke in the element for sheep is extended to form the first stroke for grains of rice.		Here we have the requirements to be counted among the ranks of the noble Esq. You must posses a forested estate, herds of sheep, and granary full of grains of rice.	This is -Sama, a generic high term of respect for someone in an unusual profession. If you met a person that created a wooden sheep that was squeezing a single grain of rice out of its ass, you´d definitely call that person -sama. Because that is impressive.	3	3	ヨウ、ショウ	さま、さん	様 (さま)
1004	request	Cầu	求	request, arrow, grains of rice	7	26	Let the drop in the upper right-hand corner of this character close the right angle off to make an arrowhead. Whenever we find the needle with that drop in an element that has no other special meaning, we will take advantage of this primitive meaning. At the bottom, we see the grains of rice, the vertical line doubling up for the two elements. Do not confuse with petition (Frame 143).		"Enemy: ""Any final requests?"" // MacGyver: ""Just an arrowhead and some grains of rice."" (MacGyver then throws the grains of rice at the enemy and uses the arrowhead to cut his hands free from the rope.)."	Robin Hood holds his rich victim at arrowpoint and kindly requests that he hands over his grains of rice.	4	3	キュウ、グ	もと.める	求める (もと.める)

1007	bamboo	Trúc	竹	bamboo	6	26	Bamboo grows upwards, like a straight nail, and at each stage of its growth (which legend associates with the arrival of the new moon) there is a jointed rootstock (the first stroke). Two such bamboo stalks are pictured here.	* As a primitive, the meaning remains the same, but the vertical lines are severely abbreviated so that they can take their place at the top where, like flowers, they are always to be found.	Pandas like to eat bamboo. I´m using panda as the primitive name when it fits the story. ^__^.	Two reclining victims impaled on bamboo spheres...　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　チク　松竹梅　しょうちくばい(pine, bamboo, plum).	1	2	チク	たけ	竹 (たけ)

1009	bamboo hat	Lạp (cái nón, cái lồng bàn)	笠	bamboo hat, bamboo, vase, stand up	11	26	Bamboo . . . vase.		The bamboo vase was beautifully crafted, but the tourist didn´t know what it was and wore it as a little bamboo hat.	The bamboo part is easy. Just remember that this kanji refers to those particular bamboo hats that are worn primarily by Buddhist monks, who always seem to stand outside of train stations, collecting alms.	Names		リュウ	かさ	
1010	bamboo grass	Sậy (cỏ sậy)	笹	bamboo grass, bamboo, generation	11	26	Bamboo . . . generation.		The bamboo generation smokes bamboo grass.

1012	muscle	Cân (gân cơ)	筋	muscle, bamboo, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, power, muscle, arnold	12	26	Bamboo . . . part of the body . . . power. Here we see how the primitive meaning of muscle was derived from the kanji for power.		Muscle is part of the body that gives strength, and can be both supple and tense like the bamboo.	Lifting BAMBOO STICKS is an old way for your BODY to put on lots of MUSCLE.	6	1	キン	すじ	筋 (すじ)
1013	box	Tương, sương (cái hộp)	箱	box , bamboo, inter, Inter Milan, tree, wood, eye	15	26	Bamboo . . . inter-.

1016	etc.	Đẳng (?)	等	etc., bamboo, Buddhist temple, soil, dirt, ground, glue	12	26	Bamboo . . . Buddhist temple.

1017	calculate	Toán	算	calculate, bamboo, eye, two hands	14	26	Bamboo . . . eyes . . . two hands.		Before the time of digital calculators, people used old school calculators made of bamboo (abacus). It´s not as easy as a calculator, but you don´t need any batteries either. All you need are your eyes and your two hands.	Tip : you may see this as an Abacus, which is used to calculate. This particular ancient chinese Abacus has eyeballs in place of beads, and its frame is made of bamboo. You´d be amazed at how fast people can calculate with this, especially if they can use both hands at once to move the ... eyeballs.	2	2	サン	そろ	
1018	solution	Đáp	答	solution, bamboo, fit, meeting, umbrella, one, mouth	12	26	Bamboo . . . fit.		The solution to this puzzle is, like the match stick game, to make the bamboo pieces fit together.

(Elaboration of jameserb´s story:) A clever scheme from Wile E Coyote -- he ties one of those rubber belts to some trees and uses it to launch a bamboo spear at the roadrunner...	The temples in kyoto belt bamboo around trees in a scheme to protect them from the huge number of tourists. (true story)-----------対策　　たいさく　　measure, countermeasure.	6	1	サク		
1020	register	Bộ	簿	register, bamboo, water, water droplets, water pistol, acupuncturist, specialty, drop, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue	19	26	Bamboo . . . water . . . acupuncturist.		Note : the keyword is not a verb, think of a record book. This acupuncturist who uses bamboo in place of flowers to dilute water into his patients (see frame 227), managed somehow to appear on the register of acupuncturists. Chances are, he won´t stay on the register for long. My image is close to that of gorgon´s story.	This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD) register. Pumping that much water into a body can be dangerous; see the huge bamboo stems with gallons of water sloshing in and out of the patient.	JH	1	ボ		
1021	fabricate	Trúc	築	fabricate, bamboo, barge, craft, mediocre, wind, drop, tree, wood	16	26	Bamboo . . . craft . . . mediocre . . . wood/tree.		Bamboo crafting is a mediocre substitute for wood when you are building or fabricating a house. While it may look good and might attract a chick (ちく) or two, the kids´ll (きず) just tear it to pieces as its not sturdy enough.	A bamboo fabrication is a mediocre substitute for wood.	5	2	チク	きず.く	築く (きず.く)
1023	person	Nhân	人	person	2	27	The character for enter (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for person, shown here, represents someone walking outwards.	* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of person so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use person for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular person. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.	"Behold Mister T (of ""A-Team"" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he´s sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he´s both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic” person, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”."	[I appreciate some people´s occasional habit of using P for person in shared stories. That makes it easier to substitute Mr. T, Captain Picard, or whomever else a student is using as person.].	1	5	ジン、ニン	ひと、-り、-と	人道 (じんどう), 人員 (じんいん), 成人 (せいじん), 人 (ひと)
1024	assistant	Tá	佐	assistant, person, left, by one’s side, craft	7	27	Person . . . left.		"Mr T´s assistant is on his left. Why? Because Mr T has this bad habit of suddenly extending his right arm (what with all the boxing that he did), and his assistant got inadvertently punched in the face more than once (ouch). So now his assistant is always to his left side, much safer - ""Stay on my left, foo!""."	"On your right is your ""right-hand man"" that you credit for all your success....on the left...... is your assistant who does all the grunt work and gets no credit for anything..."	JH	1	サ

Mister T works out his body (body-building), using two piles of books (i.e. an exercise that can be done at home with two chairs, similar to push-ups but working mostly the shoulders, trapezius and triceps).	Mr. T works out his body then rips a book apart to test is body. His favorite to destroy is Dianetics.	2	4	タイ、テイ	からだ、かたち	体格 (たいかく), 人体 (じんたい), 主体 (しゅたい), 体 (からだ)

1089	sagacious	Tuấn	俊	sagacious, person, streetwalker, Ministry of silly walks, John Cleese, license, elbow, human legs, walking legs	9	27	Person . . . license . . . walking legs.		The entire town wants to get rid of legal prostitutes, but the sagacious Mr T realizes that they are a benefit to the economy and society. So he lets the sa-geishas stay.	(re: sweetneet) Since he is not very sagacious, Mr. T failed his driver´s license and now needs to resort to his walking legs to get around.	JH	1	シュン		
1090	bystander	Bàng (bàng quan)	傍	bystander, person, traffic cop, fez, vase, stand up, crown, compass, direction	12	27	Person . . . stand . . . crown . . . compass.		In Japan, the emperor is a bystander - he stands on his crown but can´t really affect the direction of the country. (thx shimouma).	Mr. T is in the street, standing up, wearing an golden crown and a compass in his hand... he´s asking the bystander if they know how to get to buckingham palace (!).

1092	long time	Cửu (vĩnh cửu)	久	long time, bound up, person, mummy	3	27	This character uses the diagonal sweep of the second stroke to double up for bound up and a person. Think of a mummy, and the key word will not be far behind.		Note: this is the ひさ in ひさしぶり . Long time no see mummy! (A bound up person).	"This is a picture of a person bowing ""long time no see!""."	5	2	キュウ、ク	ひさ.しい	永久 (えいきゅう), 持久 (じきゅう), 耐久 (たいきゅう), 久しい (ひさ.しい)
1093	furrow	Mẫu	畝	furrow, top hat, rice field, brains, long time, mummy, bound up, person	10	27	Think of the three kinds of furrows shown here in this character - a top hat's rim, a rice field's ridges, and the wrinkles that show you've been around a long time.		Using a TOP HAT to make FURROWS in the RICE FIELD takes a LONG TIME!	A mummy tries to furrow his brow but realizes that he´s got no head - just a brain with a top-hat on it. So he furrows his brain. [trigger: furrow your brain].	JH	1	ボウ、ホ、モ、ム	せ、うね	畝 (うね), 畝 (せ)
1094	captured	Tù	囚	captured, pent in, person	5	27	Person . . . pent in.		A person pent in is obviously captured. Imagine a man put inside a wooden box, his evil capturers waiting for ransom money.	Mr. T can´t be captured. This kanji is lying.	JH	1	シュウ	とら.われる	
1095	inside	Nội	内	inside, person, belt	4	27	Person . . . belt. Note that we cannot use the primitive meaning of hood here because the person runs THROUGH the element, not under it.		Mr. T´s new belt is huge! When he´s inside it, his feet no longer touch the ground!	How is a person ever supposed to get inside that girl when she´s wearing such a huge chastity belt? I guess that´s kinda the point, eh?	2	3	ナイ、ダイ	うち	内外 (ないがい), 内容 (ないよう), 家内 (かない), 内 (うち)

The kanji meaning ""inside"" should not be used because of its proximity to the element for ""in."""		In this third class flight, the seatbelts are so bad that with the slightest turbulence all the persons hit the ceiling. (it´s almost pictographic here!).	But third class is so small Mr. T´s head hits the celing.	JH	1	ヘイ	ひのえ	
1097	design	Bính (cái cán, cái chuôi)	柄	design, tree, wood, third class, one, ceiling, inside, person, belt	9	27	Tree . . . third class.		"The third class seats on the train are very simply designed.

The tree grain design was too expensive for the third class airline to use for the panelling. They just painted it."	Half Way!!!!	JH	1	ヘイ	がら、え、つか	柄 (え), 柄 (がら)
1098	meat	Nhục	肉	meat, person, inside, belt, person, person2	6	27	"Let this doubling of one of the elements for ""inside"" yield the sense of ""insides"" to approach the key word, meat. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of flesh or part of the body for the kanji 月."		Here we are looking at an x-ray of a cannibal whose insides are full on people-meat.	A person´s inside - fleshy, raw, pink, meat.	2	4	ニク	しし

1104	monme	Chỉ (đơn vị đo khối lượng)	匁	monme, bound up, tucked under the arm	4	28	This character obliges us once again to make use of a Japanese key word for want of an English equivalent. It refers to an old unit of weight, equal to about 3.75 grams. The word is only slightly more useful in modern Japanese than cubits and kites are in modern English. Its primitives, if you look closely, are: bound up . . . arm.		"Dude! What happened to your arm! It´s all bound up! ""Yeah man, it´s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one monme!""."	"Dude! What happened to your arm! It´s all bound up! ""Yeah man, it´s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one monme!"" ""You´ll never be able to use your dagger now!""

Think of him (or her, for that matter) making a living ""by means of the sweat of their brows."""		"A man earns his living by means of the plow. I imagine a sweating man dragging a bronze-age ""ard"" behind him as he plows his field himself, too poor to afford an ox."

1106	similar	Tự (tương tự)	似	becoming, similar, person, by means of, plow, drop, person	7	28	Be sure to keep this key word distinct from likeness (Frame 104). Its elements: person . . . by means of.		Mr. T finds that living by means of dragging a plow is similar to slavery.	A Mr T impersonator is becoming similarer (more like) by means of plastic surgery.

Mr. T furiously works a puzzle in an attempt to join Mensa, the high-IQ society.	Why do I gotta join these two puzzle pieces? I ain´t got time for joining no jigsaw-jabba!

(cue secrets tune from Zelda).	JH	2	ビン	かめ	
1110	Shinto shrine	Cung (cung điện)	宮	shinto shrine, house, spine, mouth, drop, mouth2	10	28	Way back in lesson 2 we learned the character for spine. The two other characters in which it is used we can now learn together in this and the following frame. Here a Shinto shrine is composed of house and spine.		"This Shinto shrine is built with human spines. Have you ever seen the ossuary in Sedlec, near Kutna Hora in Czech Republic ? It is a small church entirely decorated with human bones. Do a web search for ""sedlec ossuary"", it´s quite a sight."

The schoolhouse is the backbone of a foundation that will allow you to find a good occupation.	"During the German occupation, this Nazi officer´s occupation was to manage schools that were requisitioned for training the children of the Aryan race to stand proud with an erect spine (mnemonic : ""the occupation´s spine schools""). Kanji meanings : to manage, to conduct (business), and also ""barracks; camp; encapment"". This story should help avoid confusion with post (#824) and employ (#1083). The military occupation theme hints to the secondary meaning, e.g. 営倉 ""detention barracks""."	5	2	エイ	いとな.む、いとな.み	営む (いとな.む)
1112	virtuous	Thiện	善	virtuous, sheep, horns, mouth	12	28	Sheep . . . horns . . . mouth. Pay special attention to the writing of this character.		"Imagine a priest´s teaching: ""To achieve virtue one must first submit himself as a sheep to God´s flock, rejecting the horns of Satan and resisting the mouth of Hell."	"To be virtuous, a good rule to follow is to put your sheepishness (discretion) over your horns (anger) before using your mouth. In other words, ""discretion is the better part of virtue""."	6	1	ゼン	よ.い、い.い、よ.く、よし.とする	善い (よ.い)
1114	year	Niên	年	year, sign of the horse, sunglasses	6	28	In an odd fashion, the kanji for year joins together the element for horse, on the top, and the right half of the element for sunglasses. Think of it as a horse wearing sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out. We will use this latter image again, so learn it now and save yourself the trouble later.		A horse wears a pair of sunglasses with one lens popped out after a particularly raucous celebration to ring in the New Year.	A horse wears a monocle for New Years to appear dignified for the year of the horse. ――one lens = monocle, you will encounter this again in kanji like descend (#1308).	1	5	ネン	とし	年 (とし)
1115	night	Dạ (ban đêm)	夜	night, top hat, person, walking legs, drop	8	28	First of all, be sure not to confuse the connotations of night with those of evening (Frame 114) and nightbreak (Frame 30). Its elements: top hat . . . person . . . walking legs . . . drop.		"Actually, the lower-right primitive isn´t quite ""walking legs."" It´s a little more like ""evening"" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for night as: evening plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the top hat which my special person is wearing out on the town..."	Here we have Mister T sleepwalking, wearing a top hat as if he was the ambassador of the night, walking, and walking and walking on his tired walking legs, until he drops (back into his bed).	2	4	ヤ	よ、よる	夜 (よ), 夜 (よる)
1116	fluid	Dịch	液	fluid, water, water droplets, water pistol, night, top hat, person, walking legs, drop	11	28	Water . . . night.		A wet dream........water fluid that comes out at night....	I imagined some kind of liquid (water) that was discovered on another planet. It solidifes during the day, and becomes fluid only at night, in the absence of light. The question is, could any lifeforms thrive in there ?	5	2	エキ		
1117	hillock	Trủng (đống đất)	塚	hillock, soil, dirt, ground, crown, pig, sow	12	28	Soil . . . crown . . . sow. Compare frame 582.		There´s already King of the Hill. This is Queen of the Hillock. It´s Ms. Piggy sitting on top of a mound of soil in her crown.	The crowned sow (we met her in overpowering) is standing atop her little mound of earth - hillock - the undisputed champeen of all the pigsty.	JH	1	チョウ	つか、-づか	塚 (つか)

You’ve heard of Edward Scissor hands? Well this is Medward Shredder Hands. Instead of nicely trimming your shrubs, he uses his TWO SHREDDER equipped HANDS to ABUSE your plants by shredding them into wood chips.	JH	1	ヘイ		
1121	yell	Hoán (hô hoán)	喚	yell, mouth, bound up, four, large, St. Bernard	12	28	The mouth on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: four St. Bernard dogs bound up in a bunch. Together they should supply a clear enough portrait of a yell, provided you are careful to see all four of them. Note how the final stroke of the four is supplied by the long horizontal stroke of the St .Bernard.		Think yelp when you hear yell to help dinstinguish this from shout (1508). I think of the sounds that would come from the mouths of the 4 dogs if they were bound up together. I´m imagining lots of yelping.	Yell? You mean, Old Yeller. Here, we see four St Bernard dogs all yelling for a chance to play a part in Old Yeller. They´re so loud that you have to bound them, and their mouths, up.	JH	1	カン	わめ.く	
1122	interchange	Hoán (giao hoán)	換	interchange, finger, fingers, bound up, four, large, St. Bernard	12	28	Fingers . . . four St. Bernard dogs bound up.		After months of practice, you finally managed to teach a nice trick to your sled-pulling four bound up St. Bernard dogs: one snap of your fingers and they interchange their positions.	On the snap of your fingers, the four St. Bernard dogs bound up interchange places.	JH	2	カン	か.える、-か.える、か.わる	換える (か.える), 換わる (か.わる)
1123	dissolve	Dung (tan chảy, dung hoà, dung hợp)	融	dissolve, tripod, one, ceiling, mouth, hood, human legs, street, nail, spike, insect	16	28	Ceiling . . . mouth . . . hood . . . human legs . . . spike . . . insect. This is the maximum number of elements to appear in any story in the book.		"I have created the element ""old camera"" out of the left side of the kanji: from the subject´s point of view, the light is captured by one mouth (the lens). The photographer is under a big hood, we only see his legs, and he is holding a spike in his right hand, which is the shutter release. Now, at the time the photographer takes the photo, a little insect is flying near the flash. The flash is so powerful that the insect is burnt and dissolves in the air."	I´ve seen this crazy thing with only one mouth that can dissolve up to 4 nails and an insect at the same time. Sweet! (It´s a venus flytrap, btw).	JH	1	ユウ	と.ける、と.かす

1125	rotation	Toàn (đi vòng tròn, quay tròn)	旋	rotation, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, zoo, critters	11	29	A banner . . . a zoo. Hint: think of a merry-go-round.		A merry-go-round with a big banner on top and below a veritable zoo of bakelite animals on poles in perpertual rotation accompanied by silly music. Giraffes, elephants, zebras, rhinos...	Don´t confuse with revolve or axis! Think of rotation as a rotation of animals in the zoo - some are on display (in rotation), some are in cages in the back (out of rotation). The ones currently in rotation (on display) are advertised with a large banner.	JH	1	セン		
1126	play	Du	遊	play, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, child, road	12	29	Banners . . . children . . . road.		The BANNER warns that CHILDREN PLAY on the ROAD.	"There is always a stupid banner talking about children at play near the road. They mean ""drive slowly"", but it sounds like its slow(stupid) children that are at play."	3	3	ユウ、ユ	あそ.ぶ、あそ.ばす	遊戯 (ゆうぎ), 遊離 (ゆうり), 交遊 (こうゆう), 遊ぶ (あそ.ぶ)
1127	trip	Lữ (lữ khách)	旅	trip, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, Carol in rags, person, rag	10	29	Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for garment, represent a rag as its primitive meaning. We shall meet this only on one other occasion. This gives us as our elements: banner . . . rag.		"The boat starts to leave on it´s trip across the Atlantic. Underneath a huge banner that spans the width of the ship and says ""Bon Voyage"", the people wave their rags signalling a safe journey for all on board the Titanic."	After a long long trip, what once was a proud beautiful banner, we had nothing more than a simple rag remaining.	3	4	リョ	たび	旅 (たび)
1128	not	Vật (không)	勿	not, knot, piglet’s tail	4	29	First take the primitive meaning of this character: knot. Think of it as the piglet minus its body (the horizontal stroke), that is, the curly tail that looks like a knot. As an exception, we will use the homonym to remember the abstract key word, not.		This kanji is NOT a piglett.	"The butcher is standing over the piglet. ""This is a piglet...(cuts of head)...NOT!""."	Names		モチ、ブツ、ボツ	なか.れ、なし	
1129	thing	Vật	物	thing, cow, knot, piglet’s tail	8	29	Cow . . . knot.		"The cow´s ""thing"" is tied in a knot! ouch."	A cow is not a thing. Its an animal.

1132	urine	Niệu	尿	urine, flag, water	7	29	Flag . . . water.		"Animals use their urine to mark their territory.

On a large scale, large pieces of soils in the world have a virtual fence called nation. Picture a world map where all countries have their soil with one color, their national flag as the legend and a fence on the borders... don´t you think it looks like a giant puzzle?	"Why the Earth has to be fenced off and flags used to represent each ""country"" is a puzzle to me - we´re all just monkeys on a big rock spinning round the Sun!"	JH	1	ヘイ、ベイ		
1137	footgear	Lý (đi, mặc, giầy)	履	footgear, flag, restore, Nelson, column, going, line, fold back, double back, reclining, lying down, sun, day, walking legs	15	29	Flag . . . restore.

"The man set his finger firmly on the map and said ""Here is where they reside, I am certain of it""."	Cf. reside (#1063): you set the flag with your fingers on the place where you reside: an old tradition.	JH	1	キョ	す.える、す.わる	据える (す.える), 据わる (す.わる)

The strata have piled up in an ever increasing pile of dirt. As the geologists go down the rocks, they flag each stratum with the name of the corresponding era.	Archaeologists at a dig site place small flags marking layers or strata of rock. Each of these layers was formerly the top layer. (This is not increase! Hseige keeps messing up).	6	2	ソウ		
1147	bureau	Cục (bộ phận)	局	bureau, flag, phrase, bound up, mouth	7	29	Flag . . . phrase. Note how the flag's long stroke doubles up for the first stroke of phrase.		The Federal Bureau of Investigation has email scanners that flag certain phrases.	They do nothing at the bureau other than repeating the stupid catchphrase they have on their flag.	3	3	キョク	つぼね

WATER always LEAKED in the spot left by the FLAG planted in the roof everytime it RAINED. Not too hard to picture a hole left in the ceiling from a flag, now leaking water.

1150	printing	Loát	刷	printing, flag, towel, sword, sabre, saber	8	29	Flag . . . towel . . . saber.		We printed a japanese flag on his white towel by stabbing him with a saber while he was wearing it.	The image that keeps coming to me is of the giant mechanical printing presses. The cloth-based material is coming off the roll like a flag and then, after printing, gets cut into sheets by saber-like cutting tools.	4	2	サツ	す.る、-ず.り、-ずり、は.く	刷る (す.る)
1151	shaku	Xích (thước)	尺	shaku, flag, stick	4	29	"The key word shaku has actually come into English in the word shakuhachi, the ancient Japanese flute that measured ""one shaku and eight sun"" (the ""sun"" being about an inch in length). Since the shaku is about one foot in length, this makes about 20 inches. Let the final sweeping stroke be like a tape measure added to the flag."	* As a primitive, this will mean the shakuhachi flute.	Slang for blowjob and that´s priceless for stories...but also the character looks like the letter R which I think of as standing for RULER (12 inches) other meanings include: rule, measure, length.	"Since this is SLANG for BLOW JOB and since it looks like an ""R"", let´s have the primitive be the R in BROW JOB. :)."	6	1	シャク

To breathe, you have your shakuhachi flute poking up through the surface of the water.	Sirens in the swamp play eerie music on their shakuhachi flutes to lure you in - you follow the enchanting music then its too late as you get trapped in the swamp!	JH	1	タク	さわ、うるお.い、うるお.す、つや	沢 (さわ)
1154	translate	Dịch	訳	translate, say, words, keitai, mouth, shaku-hachi, flag, stick	11	29	Words . . . shakuhachi.		You cannot pretend to translate into words the melody of the shakuhachi!	You all know that ´shakuhachi´ is a slang word for blowjob, right? In this kanji you got a job as a TRANSLATOR for Japanese porno movies. So you sit there all day translating dirty WORDS and watching girls perform SHAKUHACHI. This is the life!	6	1	ヤク	わけ	訳 (わけ)

Roosters in Japan are very civilised, they play the shakuhachi at nightbreak to signify the beginning of daytime.	In a Zelda game, you can warp to the daytime if you play your shakuhachi to bring about nightbreak... or your ocarina if you don´t have a shakuhachi.	2	4	チュウ	ひる	昼 (ひる)
1157	door	Hộ (cửa, hộ khẩu)	戸	door, one, flag	4	29	Ceiling . . . flag.		"Traditional Japanese storefront doors have several flags, known as ""noren,"" hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don´t usually hang from the ceiling."	A Japanese door has a noren, a flag hanging from a rod. (I give this primitive the meaning of a noren-covered door).	2	2	コ	と	戸 (と)
1158	shoulder	Kiên (vai)	肩	shoulder, door, one, ceiling, flag, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	8	29	Door . . . flesh.		The shoulder is the best part of the body to bash a door open with (Don´t ever try this. Use your foot).	The shoulder is part of the body you use to push through the noren in a doorway. I was having trouble with positioning of the primitives until I tweaked shaydwyrm´s story slightly. If you think of pushing through a noren, this makes sense as a pictograph. The noren hangs from above, and you push through it from below.	JH	2	ケン	かた	肩 (かた)

1161	hearth	Lô (lò)	炉	hearth-fire, door, one, ceiling, flag	8	29	Hearth fire . . . door.		This hearth is equipped with a fire-proof door. On the kanji you can see somewhat pictographically the fire-proof door keeping the fire behind, and nothing comes under the door primitive, where you would have expected to see another primitive.	"-""Honey? Do we have any wood left for the hearth?"" -""Aagh, just use the frickin´ door!""."	JH	1	ロ	いろり

1166	disclose	Khải (nói)	啓	disclose, bouncer, door, one, ceiling, flag, taskmaster, mouth	11	29	Door . . . taskmaster . . . mouth.		Behind closed DOORS, the TASKMASTER tortures to get prisoners to open their MOUTHS and DISCLOSE information.	You signed a non-disclosure agreement with the taskmaster but you opened your mouth as soon as you got out the door!	JH	1	ケイ	ひら.く、さと.す	
1167	show	Thị	示	show, altar, show, two, small	5	30	Although the elements two and little are available for the using, it may be easier to remember this character as a picture of an altar. Something placed atop the altar is put on show for all to see.	* As a primitive, this kanji means altar. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the altar in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side. The new appearance of this primitive form, ネ, should be kept distinct from that for cloak, identical except for the one final short stroke.	A boy made an altar, but he´s afraid to show it to God because he thinks it´s two little.	I´ll SHOW you mine if you show me yours!, she said. I did & she scoffed because it was TWO LITTLE.	5	3	ジ、シ	しめ.す	示威 (しい), 示談 (じだん), 指示 (しじ), 示す (しめ.す)
1168	salutation	Lê (lễ)	礼	salute, salutation, altar, fishhook	5	30	This key word refers to the polite bows and ceremonious forms of salutation so important in Japanese culture. Its elements: altar . . . fishhook.		Indy, my friend, you must be very careful! If you approach the altar and do not give the proper salutation a large fishhook will rip you away.	You should fish hook (bend/bow) your body before an altar as a form of salutation to God/gods.	3	3	レイ、ライ		礼儀 (れいぎ), 謝礼 (しゃれい), 無礼 (ぶれい)
1169	auspicious	Tường (điềm)	祥	auspicious, altar, sheep	10	30	Altar . . . sheep.		Bringing a sheep to sacrifice on the altar was a sign of an auspicious life. The poor could only afford a pigeon, the more auspicious an expensive sheep for an offering.	On this ewe-spicious occasion, you sacrifice a sheep at the altar. —— Sorry, but I really need more than generic altar sacrifices to connect keywords to stories. Sometimes an egregious pun is the only way.	JH	1	ショウ	さいわ.い、きざ.し、よ.い、つまび.らか	
1170	celebrate	Chúc	祝	celebrate, altar, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs	9	30	Altar . . . teenager.		It´s a Bar Mitzvah. At the altar, the teenager is singing in his awful, mid-puberty voice. We´ll all celebrate when that part is over!	When Japanese people turn 20 they usually visit the altar at their local shrine and celebrate no longer being a teenager.	4	2	シュク、シュウ	いわ.う	祝賀 (しゅくが), 祝日 (しゅくじつ), 慶祝 (けいしゅく), 祝う (いわ.う)
1171	blessing	Phúc	福	blessing, altar, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains	13	30	Altar . . . wealth.		This recalls the selling of indulgences in the history of the Church (As an aside, Protestantism began as a protest of this practice). Basically, one gave wealth to the altar (i.e. priest) and received a blessing. If you prefer a Jewish version, think of the donation (wealth) that is expected when you´re called to the ark (altar in the kanji) to give a blessing over the torah.	Put all your wealth on the church altar and receive one blessing. (You stand up out of your wheelchair or something.).	3	3	フク		
1172	welfare	Chỉ (phúc)	祉	welfare, altar, stop, footprint	8	30	Altar . . . footprint.		And in front of every altar, she stopped to pray for the welfare of the others.	Religious Republicans regularly go to the altar to pray for a stop to welfare.	JH	1	シ		
1173	company	Xã	社	company, altar, soil, dirt, ground	7	30	Altar . . . soil. The company referred to here is that of the modern business world.		When you enter a Japanese company it´s like you join a cult... your workdesk becomes your altar and you worship the very soil the office is built on.	Some Japanese companies, including Toyota, have a Shinto shrine on their grounds to bring luck and prosperity to the company and its employees.	2	4	シャ	やしろ	社 (やしろ)
1174	inspection	Thị	視	inspection, altar, see, telescope, eye, human legs	11	30	Altar . . . see.		"The beaurocracy in Japan is such that even altars need to be inspection approved. A little man with glasses comes once a year to give the altar a ""visual once over"" as he calls it (perhaps checking for unauthorised symbology?)."	[inspection; regard as; see; look at] Inspection: you 示 show (#1086) and someone else 見 see (#57).	6	1	シ	み.る	
1175	Nara	Nại (làm sao?)	奈	nara, large, St. Bernard, altar, show, two, small	8	30	We choose the city of Nara as the key word in this case because this kanji, frequently used in proper names, appears in Nara; and also because of Nara's famed religious monuments, which help us with the primitives: St. Bernard dog . . . altar.		It´s beautiful place, but the dark side of Nara is that they sacrifice St. Bernards on evil altars every night after the tourists leave!	Nara is just a big show for tourists.	JH	1	ナ、ナイ、ダイ	いかん、からなし	
1176	military officer	Uý	尉	military officer, flag, altar, show, two, small, glue	11	30	Flag . . . altar . . . glue.		Of course it had to be the military officer´s idea to glue a national flag to the altar he´s stationed at.	Perhaps you have heard about Koizumis controversial visits at the Yasukuni war memorial shrine. It is the japanese flag waving above a small stone altar. A military officer keeps watch here night and day, to honor the dead war heroes, as if he is glued to the ground.	JH	1	イ、ジョウ		
1177	consolation	Uý (yên ủi)	慰	consolation, military officer, flag, altar, show, two, small, glue, heart	15	30	Military officer . . . heart.		A military officer must offer consolation to the hearts of the families of his fallen men.	"This Kanji appears in the word 慰安婦 いあんふ, which was what the infamous WW II ""comfort women"" were called in Japanese. The story goes something like this: As a way of providing consolation to battle-weary, heartsick military officers and soldiers, the Japanese set up comfort stations (brothels) for their servicemen. (Just to be clear: this is not an endorsement of the practice, just a way to remember the Kanji.)."	JH	1	イ	なぐさ.める、なぐさ.む	慰む (なぐさ.む), 慰める (なぐさ.める)
1178	goodwill	Khoản	款	goodwill, samurai, altar, show, two, small, lack, yawn	12	30	Samurai . . . altar . . . yawning.		Samuari, altar, yawn The samurai is on the altar, preaching about goodwill. The audience just yawns however, they want to see the man fight!	For better remembering the placement of the eleements: The samurai kneels before the altar at his wedding ceremony, when some of the attendants lets out a big yawn. He is a kind man and for the day his goodwill benefits everyone. No beheadings.	JH	1	カン		
1179	prohibition	Cấm	禁	prohibition, grove, tree, wood, altar, show, two, small, tree2, wood2	13	30	Grove . . . altar.		"Similar to radical tyro´s story. If you live in Japan, your main exposure to this kanji is probably ""no smoking"" signs. So I imagine the government enacting a prohibition of tobacco, and burning whole groves of tobacco plants on an altar (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will)."	"Hidden in a grove was a church with a secret altar that was stocked full of prohibited alcohol during the American prohibition period of 1920-1933. A local registered himself as a mininster of this altar so he could stock prohibited alcohol ""for sacremental purposes"" and share it with his kin (きん)."	5	2	キン		
1180	collar	Khâm	襟	collar, cloak, prohibition, grove, tree, wood, altar, show, two, small, tree2, wood2	18	30	Cloak . . . prohibition.		A collar is the part of your cloak that, if tightened too tight, will prohibit breathing.	Collars are prohibited from wizarding cloaks. Blood purists say they´re too muggle.	JH	1	キン	えり	襟 (えり)
1181	religion	Tôn	宗	religion, house, altar, show, two, small	8	30	House . . . altar.		I never really did figure out what religion my host family was - all I knew was that they kept an altar in their home.	All the RELIGIONS have their own temples, which are houses where they place their altars.	6	1	シュウ、ソウ	むね	宗教 (しゅうきょう), 宗派 (しゅうは), 改宗 (かいしゅう)
1182	adore	Sùng	崇	adore, mountain, religion, house, altar, show, two, small	11	30	Mountain . . . religion.		In ancient Greece, it was the religion of the time to adore the gods who live on Mount Olympus.	I would adore the religious people if they just went and threw themselves off a mountain top.	JH	1	スウ	あが.める	
1183	ritual	Tế	祭	ritual, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, crotch, altar, show, two, small	11	30	Flesh . . . crotch . . . altar. Note how the second element is cut short, giving a tent-like effect to the character.		A ritual such as a circumcision: a small piece of flesh from the crotch is left on the altar.	There are many famous penis matsuris(festivals) in Japan. The rituals of these festivals involve placing the flesh of the crotch on an altar.	3	2	サイ	まつ.る、まつ.り、まつり	祭り (まつ.り), 祭る (まつ.る)
1184	guess	Sát (xét)	察	guess, house, ritual, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, crotch, altar, show, two, small	14	30	"""Guess"" here has the sense of a measured conjecture. Its elements: house . . . ritual."		I have an informed guess about whose house the dark rituals are performet at.

1185	grate	Sát (trà sát)	擦	grate, finger, fingers, guess, house, ritual, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, crotch, altar, show, two, small	17	30	Fingers . . . guess.		If you mis-guess the cheese you´ll grate your fingers on the cheese-grater (happens to me all the time).	Ouch! Guess how many fingers I just grated in the grater? (Edit: OR: Ouch! Guess what I just grated in the grater? -- my finger!).	JH	1	サツ	す.る、す.れる、-ず.れ、こす.る、こす.れる	擦る (す.る), 擦れる (す.れる)
1186	wherefore	Do	由	wherefore, sprout, shoot	5	30	"The ""wherefore"" of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a rice field sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and wherefore of the seed's falling in the earth and dying. (When the flower appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full seedling.)"	* As a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean shoot or sprout.	Wherefore art thou, Sprouteo? (Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout) (OR: A brussel sprout has fallen from Juliet´s dinner plate and rolled off).	"Cogito ergo sum. Wherefore is a bad choice here for two reasons. For one, it´s often mistranslated as ""where"" when in fact it´s an urge to know a cause or reason; and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought sprouts from my brain. I think, therefore I am.]."	3	3	ユ、ユウ、ユイ	よし、よ.る	由来 (ゆらい), 経由 (けいゆ), 自由 (じゆう), 理由 (りゆう), 事由 (じゆう), 由 (よし)
1187	pluck	Trừu (tượng, kéo ra, nẩy ra)	抽	pluck, finger, fingers, sprout, shoot	8	30	Fingers . . . sprout.		[When I see the word pluck, I think eyebrows, not vegetables. So, to avoid confusing with pick (#733):] Each time this singular, long, wiry black hair starts to sprout out of my chin again, I pluck it with my fingers.	If you pluck your fingers, new ones will sprout in their place. (try it ;).	JH	1	チュウ	ひき-	
1188	oil	Du	油	oil, water, water droplets, water pistol, sprout, shoot	8	30	Water . . . sprout.		The liquid oil that sprouts from an oil field.	In a rather surprising scientific breakthrough, genetically modified Brussel sprouts (which have become extremely absorbative), are thrown in the water to suck up oil spills.	3	2	ユ、ユウ	あぶら	油 (あぶら)
1189	sleeve	Tụ (xóc áo phải để ý cổ tay -> lĩnh tụ: người đứng đầu)	袖	sleeve, cloak, sprout, shoot	10	30	Cloak . . . sprout.		Imagine some magic cloak, that when worn, has little green sprouts appearing on the sides that grow into sleeves.	"The bad magician says, ""As you can see, there´s nothing up my sleeves!""

1190	mid-air	Trụ	宙	mid-air, house, sprout, shoot	8	30	House . . . shoot.		Jack´s beanstalk sprouted up, pushed at the roof and lifted the house so that it hangs in mid-air suspended on the SPROUT.	"Hahaha, the image of walking into a house and finding a sea of brussel sprouts floating mid-air is enough for me to remember. Maybe there´s a magician in the kitchen shouting a reassuring ""Don´t mind the sprouts!""."	6	1	チュウ		
1191	deliver	Giới	届	deliver, flag, sprout, shoot	8	30	Flag . . . sprout.		In the US, when the mail is delivered, a flag sprouts up on your mailbox. (We don´t have that in Australia.).	A Japanese man ordered some Brussel sprouts from Belgium. They are delivered with a little Belgian flag (as seen sometimes in shops, little flags indicating the provenance and authenticity of the food like cheese and meat).	6	2	カイ	とど.ける、-とど.け、とど.く	届く (とど.く), 届ける (とど.ける)
1192	flute	Địch	笛	flute, bamboo, sprout, shoot	11	30	Bamboo . . . sprout.		Flute is made of bamboo sprout.	You pick up your bamboo flute, and recoil in shock as out comes not the dulcet melody you had hoped to play, but rather a Brussels sprout! You play again, and again a Brussels sprout. A bamboo flute that plays sprouts! Fabulous! Puts that golden egg laying goose in its place.	3	1	テキ	ふえ	笛 (ふえ)
1193	axis	Trục	軸	axis, car, sprout, shoot	12	30	Car . . . shoot.		The Germans manufactured so many cars during World War II that it was almost as if they were sprouting from the factories of the Axis.	An absurd image, but what the heck - worked for me. Imagine a car going across a plain at a fast speed. Suddenly a single sprout (the only one to be seen) gets stuck to the car´s wheels, causing the car to fly around its axis.	JH	1	ジク		
1194	armor	Giáp	甲	armour, armor, roots	5	30	This kanji reverses the element for sprout, giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the rice field. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, armor.	"* The primitive meaning is roots. Important to that word is the image of ""pushing downwards,"" as roots do."	"Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai´s armor. Then I looked up images of the samurai armor and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai armor because of the ""turtle samurai"" that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess."	It looks like a bird´s eye view of a tank (modern armor).	JH	1	コウ、カン、カ	きのえ	甲乙 (こうおつ), 装甲車 (そうこうしゃ)
1195	push	Áp	押	push, finger, fingers, armour, armor, roots	8	30	Fingers . . . roots. Compare and contrast with pluck (Frame 1187).		Push the roots down, instead of plucking the seedling.	Use your fingers to make sure the roots of your plant are deep underground by pushing them down, down, down.	JH	3	オウ	お.す、お.し-、お.っ-、お.さえる、おさ.える	押さえる (お.さえる), 押す (お.す)
1196	headland	Giáp	岬	headland, mountain, armour, armor, roots	8	30	Like the cape (Frame 164) and the promontory (Frame 840), the headland refers to a jut of land. Its elements: mountain . . . roots.		A headland is a mountain that is firmly rooted despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water. (Just like your head is a mountain surrounded by air on 3 sides, a headland!).	Headlands are natural forts; in fact, once men build castles on them, they become armoured mountains. (Gibralter, for example, is basically an armoured mountain).	JH	1	コウ	みさき	岬 (みさき)
1197	insert	Tháp	挿	insert, finger, fingers, thousand, armour, armor, roots	10	30	Fingers . . . thousand . . . roots. Observe how the writing order does not follow the elements in order, because the final stroke is used for two different elements.

It is written by a tongue wagging in the mouth with a walking stick rammed through it and coming out at both ends."	"* While this kanji has obvious affinities to the ""seed"" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the monkey (the one who speaketh no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take monkey as its primitive meaning."	"I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the ""s"" and speaketh like thith becauth they have a cane in their mouth."	"I had persistent trouble confusing this one with 曰 sayeth (#578). The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in ""moshi moshi"" when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say ""hello, this is X speaking.""."	3	3	シン	もう.す、もう.し-、さる	申す (もう.す)

The main thing to notice here is the element for brains at the top, which might prove more helpful than rice field for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a sun with a tree whose trunk runs through the sun.		If only Eve had used her brains and not taken the forbidden fruit from the tree.

After I finish each chapter of RTK, I eat a piece of fruit to celebrate all the new words I´ve learned. (Thanks Misha!).	"Words signify the written words in a book. The fruit represents something whole, complete. A chapter in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It´s good to disambiguate the keyword from paragraph (#82). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each chapter of Tolstoy´s ""War and Peace"" to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you´d very quickly run out of fruit)."	4	2	カ

Have you ever seen those shots in movies where the hero is standing at the edge of a sheer mountain face, hair blowing in the wind?

I was thirsty so I gulped down the water. Then I realized I was also hungry. So I ate the flowers. Yes, I am responsible for both the missing water and the missing flowers. Yes, I´m afraid both. Am I still hungry or thirsty? Thank you for asking! How kind! But no, I feel quite full now.	4	3	マン、バン	み.ちる、み.つ、み.たす	満たす (み.たす), 満ちる (み.ちる)
1254	brush-stroke	Hoạ, hoạch (hoạ sĩ, kế hoạch)	画	brush-stroke, one, ceiling, sprout, shoot, shovel	8	31	In forming an image for the key word, it is helpful to know that this kanji is used for artistic representations (like a completed painting), and as a counter for the number of brush-strokes in a character (as, for instance, in Indexes II and III at the end of this book). Its elements are: ceiling . . . sprout . . . shovel.		You decide one day to paint a kanji on your ceiling. Unfortunately, you don’t have a brush, so, being innovative, you use a sprout. Knowing it could be messy, you search for a drop-cloth, but can’t find one. Instead, you put a shovel down on the floor to catch any drips resulting from the BRUSH-STROKEs.	To paint a kanji in your ceiling with only natural materials, you use a sprout as a brush and shovel some dirt to use as paint for your strokes. [modified from johnskb´s].	2	4	ガ、カク、エ、カイ	えが.く、かく.する、かぎ.る、はかりごと、はか.る	画家 (がか), 図画 (ずが), 映画 (えいが)
1255	tooth	Xỉ	歯	tooth, stop, footprint, bag of rice, shovel	12	31	Footprint . . . rice . . . shovel.		Stop shoveling rice into your mouth, you´ll hurt a tooth! Use chopsticks instead.	My dentist used his foot and a shovel to dislodge the rice stuck between my teeth.	3	3	シ	よわい、は、よわ.い、よわい.する	歯 (は)
1256	bend	Khúc	曲	bend, rice field, brains, stick	6	31	Picture yourself grabbing hold of the two strokes poking out the top of the kanji and wrenching them apart, thus giving the sense of bend. If you think of them as deriving from the element for brains beneath (of course, the middle stroke has been reduplicated and pulled out to where it can be grabbed hold of), you can associate the key word with bending someone's mind to your own point of view.		"It looks like the mouth of Bender the robot, from Matt Groening´s animated series ""Futurama"". Thus, I use the character Bender the robot as a primitive."	"Also means ""melody"". Think of it as a pictogram of a guitar where you have to bend the strings to make a melody."	3	3	キョク	ま.がる、ま.げる	曲がる (ま.がる), 曲げる (ま.げる)
1257	cadet	Tào (lũ bọn, chúng mày)	曹	cadet, one, bend, sun, day	11	31	This character is written in the order of its elements: one . . . bend . . . sun.		A space cadet eager to make one bend around the sun. (a dangerous maneuver).	Bender lasted just one day in the space cadets.	JH	1	ソウ、ゾウ	つかさ、ともがら、へや	
1258	encounter	Tao	遭	encounter, cadet, one, bend, sun, day, road	14	31	Cadet . . . road.		Close encounters of the third kind. The space cadet encounters aliens on the road.	"Bender the cadet (see frame 1172) has an ""encounter of the third kind"" on the road. Reference to Steven Spielberg´s 1977 movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Also a reference to popular stories of people reportedly chased by UFO´s while driving on the road."	JH	1	ソウ	あ.う、あ.わせる	遭う (あ.う)
1259	rowing	Tảo	漕	rowing, water, water droplets, water pistol, cadet, one, bend, sun, day	14	31	Water . . . cadet.		Bender the cadet (see frame 1172) is rowing, during some army exercise, and he´s very afraid of water (Bender is a robot).	The space cadet is in training, rowing in the water (see it splash).	Names		ソウ	こ.ぐ、はこ.ぶ	
1260	vat	Tào	槽	vat, tree, wood, cadet, one, bend, sun, day	15	31	Tree . . . cadet.		Also as part of some army survival exercise, the cadets (including Bender see frame 1172) are sent into the woods to build a vat (for collecting water for example).	Bender the Cadet (kudos to Fuaburisu) is found on an army training exercise, hiding behind a tree, getting drunk on the famous scotch whiskey Vat 69.	JH	1	ソウ	ふね	
1261	Big Dipper	Đấu (sao đẩu)	斗	big dipper, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle	4	31	The Big Dipper here is of course the constellation of Ursa Major, of which this kanji is a sort of pictographic representation.	"* Since we already have a primitive element for a ""dipper"" - namely, the ladle - we shall let this one stand for a measuring cup. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!"	"Ông công ông táo, thả cá Since the meaning of ""big dipper"" is rather specific and the sense of measurement seems to be a more common usage, I concentrate on the primative meaning of measuring cup. This is a pictograph, with the first two strokes representing the measuring ticks on the side of the cup."	Is it just me, or do all of these traditional kanji pictographs look like they were drawn by a retarded bunny rabbit?	JH	1	ト、トウ		
1262	fee	Liệu (nguyên, nhiên liệu)	料	fee, rice, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle	10	31	Measuring cup . . . rice.		When buying rice, the fee is calculated by the cup. Naturally we don´t just use any cup; it has to be a proper measuring cup.	Samurai(s) once received their fee in the form of rice that had been carefully weighed in a measuring cup beforehand.	4	4	リョウ		
1263	department	Khoa	科	department, wheat, cereal, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle	9	31	Think here of the faculty or department you entered in university, using the elements: measuring cup . . . wheat.		The national DEPARTMENT of WHEATS and MEASURES. Get it? This one was hard until I came up with this.	Agriculture/astronomy departments...　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　カ　科学　かがく (science).	2	3	カ		
1264	map	Đồ	図	map, pent in, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle	7	31	"Pent in . . . Big Dipper. Hint: among the songs dating from the days of slavery that have become part of American folklore is one called ""Follow the Drinking Gourd."" It referred to the nighttime travel of runaway slaves (those pent in) who had no maps other than the stars to guide them, among them the bright and predominant Big Dipper, the ""Drinking Gourd."""		Can´t see direct relation to Big Dipper (#1177) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it´s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. I take it as a pictograph or treasure map. Two dots represent big trees and the cross (marking the treasure) is placed relative to them.	A pictograph of a treasure map. Two steps east then X marks the spot. 図る はかる attempt, deceive; 地図 ちず map; 意図する いとする make a goal, intend to do.	2	4	ズ、ト	え、はか.る	図画 (ずが), 図表 (ずひょう), 地図 (ちず), 図る (はか.る)
1265	utilize	Dụng	用	utilize, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, walking stick	5	31	Meat . . . walking stick. Be sure to keep this key word distinct from that for use (Frame 1065). The stroke order is exactly as you would expect it from the order of the primitive elements as given.	* As a primitive element, we shall substitute the image of a screwdriver, perhaps the most utilized of all tools around the house.	To tenderize meat in an emergency wilderness situation, just utilize your walking stick!	"I´ll confuse this with use (#990), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, ""utilize"" has an artificial, business-speak connotation; you only utilize ""utilize"" when you´re trying to puff up what you´re saying and sound important. So: ""BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, utilizing the our latest FleshGrip(tm) technology!"" I´m seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of flesh, a short shaft, and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it."	2	4	ヨウ	もち.いる	用いる (もち.いる)
1266	comfortable	Dung	庸	commonplace, comfortable, cave, rake, screwdriver, utilise, utilize, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, walking stick	11	31	Cave . . . rake . . . screwdriver.		To live a comfortable life, single men need only a cave for living, a rake for cleaning and a screwdriver for fixing.	When I first moved in to my new cave, all I had was a bed (see bed (#592)). But now I´ve settled in, got myself a few handy things like a rake and a screwdriver, and made myself more comfortable.	JH	1	ヨウ		
1267	equip	Bị	備	equip, person, flowers, cliff, screwdriver, utilise, utilize, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, walking stick	12	31	Person . . . flowers . . . cliff . . . screwdriver. In cases like this you can jumble up the primitive into any order that seems best for the composition of a story, provided you feel confident about the relative position that those primitives take to one another in the completed character.		Mr. T wants to climb up and pick the flowers at the top of the cliff. He equips himself with screwdrivers to use as climbing spikes to reach the top of the cliff. Imagine a large AMMO belt full of philips screwdrivers instead of bullets.	An RPG where you´re using Mr T as a character. Before you enter a battle, you equip the flower cliff screwdriver. This is a small screwdriver obtained at the bottom of a cliff that, when used in battle, shoots out pink flowers. When they touch the ground in front of the enemy, they create a massive cliff, and the ground under the enemy falls away into the sea. Picture being at the item select menu and EQUIPping this item just before facing a tough boss.	5	3	ビ	そな.える、そな.わる、つぶさ.に	備える (そな.える), 備わる (そな.わる)
1268	once upon a time	Tích	昔	once upon a time, salad, flowers, one, floor, sun, day	8	32	Salad . . . days. This is the character with which Japanese fairytales commonly begin.		Once upon a time, the children were forced to eat their salad every day.	"For those who don´t know the expression, ""salad days"" means the time of one´s youth. (originally from Shakespeare´s Antony and Cleopatra - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days).

1269	confused	Thác (lẫn lộn, lầm lẫm, thác loạn)	錯	confused, metal, gold, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day	16	32	Metal . . . once upon a time.		A long time ago, people of the world got confused because there were so many kinds of Metal coins. today we only have the euro.	"Once upon a time, it was thought that the ancient ""art"" of alchemy could transform anything into gold. At that time, people were obviously confused about the difference between reality and myth. (Arguably people are still as confused as ever, just about different things now.)."	JH	1	サク、シャク		
1270	borrow	Tá	借	borrow, person, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day	10	32	Person . . . once upon a time.		"Once upon a time I let Mr T borrow my salad bowl, but he won´t give it back.

The sense of the key word is that of a lost opportunity or bad turn of affairs, as in the phrase ""What a pity!"""		What a pity!

1272	set aside	Thố (đặt, để)	措	set aside, finger, fingers, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day	11	32	Fingers . . . once upon a time.		Long ago our ancestors set aside the use of fingers and began to use cutlery. (Raichu,11-7-2006) The way I remember it´s 昔 once upon a time (#1184) rather than 旧 olden times (#35) is that they began to use cutlery to eat salad. (I also think about how when you visit the Medieval Times theme park, which is set in Once upon a time, their gimmick is that you eat with your fingers.).	Once upon a time... Oh hell, you´re just too old for this. You close your fairy tale book and set it aside, pushing it away with your fingers.	JH	1	ソ	お.く	
1273	scatter	Tán	散	scatter, salad, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, taskmaster	12	32	Salad . . . flesh . . taskmaster.		The taskmaster is dissatisfied with the meal she´s served, and scatters the salad & meat across the floor for the servants to clean up.	Perhaps you´ve heard of Nyotaimori or Nantaimori (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyotaimori) in which sushi is ate from the flesh of a naked person, the story comes easily. Scatter salad over the flesh of the taskmaster in preperation for some nantaimori :).	4	3	サン	ち.る、ち.らす、-ち.らす、ち.らかす、ち.らかる、ばら	散らかす (ち.らかす), 散らかる (ち.らかる), 散らす (ち.らす), 散る (ち.る)
1274	twenty	Trấp, niệm	廿	twenty	4	32	The two tens joined at the bottom by a short line is actually the old character for twenty, which we might as well learn since we need its primitive form. It is written the same as salad, except for the shorter final stroke.		A generation is 30, one stroke less is twenty.	Ten plus ten is twenty (see generation (#28)).	Names		ジュウ、ニュウ	にじゅう	
1275	commoner	Thứ	庶	commoner, caverns, cave, twenty, oven-fire, barbecue	11	32	Caverns . . . oven fire.		Commoners have to huddle in caverns around a campfire, while higher class people get heating and central air conditioning in a hotel.	If you are so poor that you are a commoner, you will have to live twenty commoners to a cavern, with only one fire for everyone to share.	JH	1	ショ		
1276	intercept	Già	遮	intercept, commoner, caverns, cave, twenty, oven-fire, barbecue, road	14	32	Commoner . . . road.		The commoners are revolting!

JH	1	シャ	さえぎ.る	遮る (さえぎ.る)
1277	seat	Tịch	席	seat, caverns, cave, twenty, towel	10	32	Caverns . . . towel.		Remember those poor commoners huddled in groups of 20 in a cave? The only thing they had for a seat was some old toweling (while their lords could recline on luxurious couches).	You´re tired from walking the tour at this cavern and there´s no benches to sit down on, so you take a towel and sling it up into a hammock-like seat using the stalagmites. (Big no-no).	4	3	セキ	むしろ	
1278	degrees	Độ	度	degrees, caverns, cave, twenty, crotch	9	32	This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: caverns . . . crotch.		The cavern refugees are so poor that they can´t afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their crotches inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in degrees from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs...	The cave is twenty degrees cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.	3	4	ド、ト、タク	たび、-た.い	度胸 (どきょう), 制度 (せいど), 限度 (げんど), 法度 (ほうど), 度 (たび)
1279	transit	Độ	渡	transit, water, water droplets, water pistol, degrees, caverns, cave, twenty, crotch	12	32	Water . . . degrees.		This particular form of transit is a ferry (one of the actual meanings of this character). Naturally it can only cross the water if it´s not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 degrees.	The transit system in Tokyo is one of the best in the wrold, but why is it that when it is 35 degrees outside, it is about 2 degrees on the train? Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!	JH	3	ト	わた.る、-わた.る、わた.す	渡す (わた.す), 渡る (わた.る)
1280	bustle	Bôn	奔	bustle, large, St. Bernard, haystack, ten, needle, needle3, ten3	8	32	The hustle and bustle of this character is depicted by a St. Bernard dog and a haystack.		Hustle and bustle = a big St. Bernard dog frisking about in a haystack, knocking it down and spreading the hay about, after the field hands just stacked it up.	A bustle is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. Here´s a St. Bernard dog jammed ass-first into the top of a haystack, looking like some kind of proper Victorian-era lady as he struggles to get out.	JH	1	ホン	はし.る	
1281	erupt	Phun	噴	erupt, mouth, pitchfork, haystack, ten, needle, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, needle3, ten3	15	32	Mouth . . . haystack . . . clams.		History of Pompei: An unexpect eruption and from the mouths of the volcano come lava that threatens the farmers collecting haystacks in the fields and the fisherman catching shells on the coast.	A bit nasty (but makes the whole thing much easier to remember) is to take the right side and call it a bearded clam. For erupt, you can make your own story about the mouth/opening on the left.	JH	1	フン	ふ.く	噴く (ふ.く)
1282	tomb	Phần	墳	tomb, soil, dirt, ground, pitchfork, haystack, ten, needle, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, needle3, ten3	15	32	Soil . . . haystack . . . clams. In order not to confuse this kanji with that for a grave (Frame 246), something like the image of an Egyptian tomb should be adopted, with all its special connotations.		After the eruption all is a tomb. The soil has covered the remains of the farmers gathering haystacks and of the fisherman collecting shells.	Using soil and hay to make bricks, the Egyptians built the pyramids to entomb the Pharaohs along with all of their money.	JH	1	フン		
1283	aroused	Phân (phẫn)	憤	aroused, Freud, state of mind, pitchfork, haystack, ten, needle, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, needle3, ten3	15	32	State of mind . . . haystack . . . clams.		Think of the angry state of mind aroused at finding all your clams buried under your haystack stolen, gone!	Data was aroused/indignant when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their haystacks and the fishermen collecting their shells . The tragedy of it all aroused him so much he didn´t even notice he was feeling emotion.	JH	1	フン	いきどお.る	憤る (いきどお.る)
1284	bake	Thiêu	焼	bake, hearth fire, lofty, strawman, wickerman, haystack, ten, needle, one, human legs, needle3, ten3	12	32	Hearth . . . straw man. Take care to distinguish this kanji from cook (Frame 507) and burn (Frame 549) when you compose your story.		Ah, there´s no better way to bake a pizza than an oven fueled by a burning strawman. And if you listen carefully, there are stifled strawman screams coming from the kitchen. Think of this image: http://users.mtrx.net/funnypics/content/-rdm1-ABCD1234-rdm1-/2005/2005-08-23-0002/Doughboy.jpg.	Too lofty (#2095)尭 a career choice for the strawman becoming a baker. He was fired soon after starting his first shift. Literally!...　　　RTK2:　ショウ　全焼　ぜんしょう(entirely destroyed by fire).	4	2	ショウ	や.く、や.き、や.き-、-や.き、や.ける	焼く (や.く), 焼ける (や.ける)
1285	daybreak	Hiếu	暁	daybreak, sun, lofty, strawman, wickerman, haystack, ten, needle, one, human legs, needle3, ten3	12	32	Sun . . . straw man.		The sun rising beside a straw man in a corn field is a classic cartoon depiction of daybreak.	The first person to see the sun at daybreak is of course the straw man who stands outside all day.	JH	1	ギョウ、キョウ	あかつき、さと.る	暁 (あかつき)
1286	half	Bán	半	half, small, ten, needle	5	32	Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a little needle - the kind used for splitting hairs in half. (Again, according to rule, little takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.)		"Imagine karate chopping the number three in half with a WALKING STICK and pausing the picture just as the first ""board"" breaks."	I think of this as a pictograph, there are three boards to cut, the first one is already in half and there are still two more to go.	2	5	ハン	なか.ば	半ば (なか.ば)
1287	consort	Bạn	伴	consort, person, half	7	32	Person . . . half.		"The person who is your consort is most commonly ""your other half""."	Mr. T wants to splits himself in half so he can be his own CONSORT.	JH	1	ハン、バン	ともな.う	同伴 (どうはん), 随伴 (ずいはん), 伴う (ともな.う)
1288	paddy ridge	Bạn	畔	paddy-ridge, rice field, brains, half	10	32	Rice field . . . half. The key word here refers to the ridges that rise up between the sections of a rice paddy.		A PADDY-RIDGE divides the RICE FIELD in HALF.	Think about a large rice field as a big square. Then you draw a line down the middle, halving it into two. Then you draw a line across the middle, halving it again into four... These halvings are paddy-ridges that separate the rice field into separate sections. I dunno the reason why, but that´s how it´s done.	JH	1	ハン	あぜ、くろ、ほとり	
1289	judgment	Phán	判	judgement, half, sword, sabre, saber	7	32	Half . . . saber. You might recall the famous judgment of King Solomon, who offered to slice a baby in two with a saber to give half to each of the mothers who claimed it as her own.		In the bible, King Solomon´s JUDGMENT was admired not by saying to cut the baby in HALF with the SWORD, but that it revealed who the true mother was.	It takes good judgement to cut things in exactly half with a saber.	5	3	ハン、バン	わか.る	判定 (はんてい), 判明 (はんめい), 裁判 (さいばん)
1291	ticket	Khoán	券	ticket, quarter, sword, dagger	8	32	Quarter . . . dagger.		Entering the movie, the dude asks for your ticket, so he can tear it in half. He looks at you funny when you hand him a ticket already torn in half. He quietly tears the stub into quarters after you show him your dagger with a smile.	In Japan, the JR railway ju-hachi-kippu seasonal discount ticket can be cut into quarters with a dagger and shared with your friends. (its actually sort-of true).	5	2	ケン		
1292	scroll	Quyển	巻	scroll, quarter, snake, self	9	32	Quarter . . . snake. The key word refers to a manuscript rolled up into a scroll, not to a hanging scroll (Frame 435).		At a mysterious bazaar, you happen to come across something interesting: a rolled-up scroll for only 25¢. You buy it up impulsively until you realize that the powerful spell contained within is cursed by a poisonous snake. If you try to cast this spell, the snake will pop out of nowhere and bite you! Hrmph. No wonder it was so cheap...	How to make snake maki: Take a snake. Roll it up in rice and nori (seaweed paper) like a scroll. Cut into quarters and serve on a wooden geta with ginger and wasabi.	6	2	カン、ケン	ま.く、まき、ま.き	巻き (ま.き), 巻く (ま.く)
1293	sphere	Quyển	圏	sphere, pent in, scroll, quarter, snake, self	12	32	This key word refers to a realm or orbit, not to a ball. Its elements: pent in . . . scroll.		I assosiate scrolls with spell casting, the efect of this spell is pent in a certain sphere of influence, outside it no damage is done.	[RPG] You´re fighting a powerful enemy. Your mage uses a scroll/quartersnake of protection, and he´s pent in a sphere of protection.	JH	1	ケン	かこ.い	
1294	victory	Thắng	勝	victory, edam, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, quarter, power, muscle, arnold	12	32	Moon . . . quarter . . . muscle.		After your VICTORY cut your enemy´s FLESH into QUARTERs to show your POWER.	After England´s victory over Scottish rebel William Wallace, they had his flesh drawn and quartered and then sent around Britain to demonstrate their power.	3	3	ショウ	か.つ、-が.ち、まさ.る、すぐ.れる、かつ	勝つ (か.つ), 勝る (まさ.る)
1295	wisteria	Đằng	藤	wisteria, flowers, edam, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, quarter, grains of rice	18	32	Flower . . . moon . . . quarter . . . rice grains.		According to legend, the great Ogaki wisteria tree grew and flowered from magical rice grains that were planted under the quarter moon.	The wisteria is a type of hanging vine covered with flowers. By the light of the quarter moon, the flowers look like clusters of rice grains.	JH	1	トウ、ドウ	ふじ	藤 (ふじ)
1296	facsimile	Đằng	謄	mimeograph, facsimile, edam, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, quarter, say, words, keitai, mouth	17	32	Moon . . . quarter . . . words.		Sending a facsimile to the moon can be problematic only a quarter of the words actually get there.	"As a prank, a guy sits with his butt flesh on the facsimile machine, inserts a quarter, and tries to fax it to his boss. However the facsimile machine has pattern recognition technology and instead of an image of his flesh, it just transmits the word ""asshole"". Don´t forget it´s flesh, not words, on the left side; the flesh image gets transformed into words."	JH	1	トウ		
1297	one-sided	Phiến	片	one-sided, waiter with wine on tray	4	32	This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle. When that picture's right side is isolated, it becomes the kanji for one-sided, in the sense of only one part of a whole.		Fuaburisu´s pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife is a one-sided version of the story. Others say he was giving her the finger.	Taking the keyword in the sense of only one part of a whole, I see this as a pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife (I couldn´t see any trees or branches in there).	6	2	ヘン	かた-、かた	片 (かた)
1298	printing block	Phản	版	printing block, one-sided, waiter with wine on tray, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch	8	32	"Although this character also carries the sense of an ""edition"" of a publication, the elements, one-sided and anti-, more readily suggest its other meaning of a printing block."		Before the advent of printers in Japan, typewriters couldn´t be built as they were in the west due to how many kanji there are. Lots of small printing blocks had to be used instead. One side of the printing block would have a mirrored (anti) image of the kanji. This is true.	Nazi propaganda. Picture the printing blocks producing very one-sided (Aryan), anti-Jewish propaganda spreading posters to hang around town.	5	2	ハン		
1299	of	Chi	之	of, Zorro, building blocks, zig-zag	3	32	This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it.	* In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to building blocks with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child.	Of all the kanji, this is the only one 之orro can write.	The Z of Zorro (and yes he has a hat).	Names	1	シ	の、これ、おいて、ゆく、この	
1300	destitution	Phạp	乏	destitution, drop, of, Zorro, building blocks, zig-zag	4	32	Drop of . . . building blocks.		Just one drop (of alcohol) and he starts walking in zig-zags – no wonder Zorro´s living in destitution. (Note: As a primitive let 之 be Zorro or Zig-Zag: it´s pictographic).	Children in complete destitution have no hope of ever getting toys to play with, so when they find even a tiny drop of a building block they are overjoyed.	JH	1	ボウ	とぼ.しい、とも.しい	乏しい (とぼ.しい)
1301	turf	Chi (cỏ)	芝	turf, flowers, of, Zorro, building blocks, zig-zag	6	32	Flowers . . . building blocks.

1302	negative	Bất	不	negative, one, ceiling, person, drop	4	32	You may play with the primitives of this kanji as you wish (ceiling . . . person . . . a drop of), but you will probably find that its simplicity, and its frequency, make it easy to remember just as it is.		"[Smithsonian] Scene: Mr. T hanging from the ceiling being tortured. He is asked if he is going to talk. Spitting (a drop of saliva) in the torturer´s face, he says ""Negative""."	One below zero is a negative number.	4	4	フ、ブ		不当 (ふとう), 不利 (ふり), 不賛成 (ふさんせい)
1303	negate	Phủ	否	negate, negative, mouth	7	32	Negative . . . mouth.		To distinguish between 否 negate, and 不 negative (#1217): Note that negate contains 口, which is a kind of gate.	Negative mouths negate everything.	6	3	ヒ	いな、いや	否 (いな)
1304	cupfuls	Bôi	杯	cupfuls, tree, wood, negative	8	32	Tree . . . negative.		The maple tree is very negative about it, but the farmer still collects cupfuls of maple syrup from it.	A few cupfuls of sake can create a very negative situation. Like smashing into that tree...　　RTK2:　ハイ　一杯　いっぱい(one cupful).	JH	3	ハイ	さかずき	杯 (さかずき)
1305	dart	Thỉ	矢	dart, drop, heavens	5	33	"When shot high into the heavens, the dart gets so small it looks like a mere drop. Although this character could as well mean ""arrow,"" it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word."		Zeus ran out of lightning bolts and has to drop darts from the heavens.	Do not mistake with LOSE 失.	2	1	シ	や	矢 (や)
1306	rectify	Kiểu	矯	rectify, dart, drop, heavens, angel, heavens, mouth, hood, mouth, mouth2	17	33	Dart . . . angel. Compare your stories for correct (Frame 405), revise (Frame 362), and reformation (Frame 567).		Angels have now been given a powerful tool to rectify human behavior instantly, without delay - they have been allowed to drop darts on those who misbehave... spare the dart and spoil the man...	The darts of the angel Cupid are supposed to bring people joy, but usually just make things a lot worse. Here we see another angel flying around shooting people with the anti-darts (antidote), to rectify the situation.	JH	1	キョウ	た.める	矯める (た.める)
1307	tribe	Tộc	族	tribe, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, dart, drop, heavens	11	33	Banner . . . dart.

1311	halberd	Mâu (cái giáo, mâu thuẫn)	矛	halberd, beforehand	5	33	The halberd's battle-ax head and long shaft are depicted here. Take care with the number and order of the strokes.		マオ Zedong always carried a halberd.	Make the halberd a heroic warrior (perhaps of scandinavian origin) who weilds this polearm - the most effective, brutal and vicious one - with great skill. He can use it to hook, pierce and chop (the three strokes).	JH	1	ム、ボウ	ほこ	矛 (ほこ)
1312	tender	Nhu	柔	tender, halberd, beforehand, tree, wood	9	33	Halberd . . . tree.		[tender; weakness; gentleness; softness] Love me tender, Love me perfect, Never cheat on me. Or I´ll impale you on my Halberd, And hang ya atop a tree...	Use a halberd to tenderize a tree: halberds can chop, poke, and slash, so it´s all good!

It is with the halberd he holds that the taskmaster exerts his power over those actually performing the task.	"So many video games have a ""boss"" stage you must pass in order to advance to the next level. Here, your task is to use your halberd to beat the taskmaster with the huge, bulging muscles."	5	3	ム	つと.める	務める (つと.める)
1314	fog	Vụ	霧	fog, rain, weather, task, halberd, beforehand, taskmaster, power, muscle, arnold	19	33	Weather/rain . . . task.		This fog is the perfect weather for us to perform our task undetected.	FOG is easy to associate with the RAIN primitive. So think of FOG as a type of RAIN that is slow at the TASK of getting the place wet.	JH	1	ム、ボウ、ブ	きり	霧 (きり)
1315	squad	Ban	班	squad, sword, spear, cutlass, king, jewel, ball, king2, jewel2, ball2	10	33	Spear . . . two balls.		"Am I the only one who took this as penis and balls?

A spear on the floor separates their dancing areas.	6	1	ハン

The character for lady (Frame 1234) shares the same right side as this character, which does not bode for a very happy homecoming.		A female warrior returns home from battle. Her husband takes away her spear to symbolize the end of fighting and gives her a broom and an apron. “Boy, this is some kind of HOMECOMING,” thinks the veteran. (Adapted from johnskb).	Well, the boss man warrior upon his homecoming has set aside his spear. Remember the lady (#1151) (who put aside her broom and apron)? I wonder what they´re doing now?	2	4	キ	かえ.る、かえ.す、おく.る、とつ.ぐ	帰す (かえ.す), 帰る (かえ.る)
1317	bow	Cung	弓	bow	3	33	This character pictures the bent wooden bow. Later we will learn how to make the bowstring that goes with it (Frame 1490). If you stretch this character out and see the indentation on the left as its handle, the pictography should be clearer.		My personification for this primative is Legolas from the Lord of the Rings: a master at the bow. I suppose robin hood etc would work too.	I have a BOW made from a SNAKE that I BOUND UP. He sure wasn´t happy!	2	1	キュウ	ゆみ	弓 (ゆみ)
1318	pull	Dân	引	pull, bow, stick	4	33	Bow . . . walking stick.		Put a walking stick in the bow and pull it back, ready to fire at the geezer.	This is actually a bow and an arrow. (Real origin of this kanji). Pull and release to fire!	2	3	イン	ひ.く、ひ.き、ひ.き-、-び.き、ひ.ける	引く (ひ.く), 引ける (ひ.ける)

They constantly shoot at each other but never manage to hit their target. But what they lack in skill they make up in determination, and they keep shooting for hours, and days, and months, until it´s wintertime and their bows are coated in ice.	BOWS with ICE on them are brittle and WEAK.	2	2	ジャク	よわ.い、よわ.る、よわ.まる、よわ.める	弱い (よわ.い), 弱まる (よわ.まる), 弱める (よわ.める), 弱る (よわ.る)

Re CharleyGarrett: This liquid looks like ordinary water, but it will instantly seethe when it comes in contact with counterfeit dollar bills. The inventor must be rich (and probably has dollar signs in his eyes).	When his daughter used a lot of water for her shower, the father could practically see the dollar signs, so he was seething with anger.	JH	2	フツ	わ.く、わ.かす	沸かす (わ.かす), 沸く (わ.く)
1326	expense	Phí	費	expense, dollar, bow, stick, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, stick2	12	33	Dollar sign . . . shells/money.

1327	No.	Đệ	第	no., bamboo, dollar, bow, stick	11	33	"The key word No. is the abbreviation for ""number."" Its elements: bamboo . . . dollar sign."		The No. 1 currency in the world is the dollar. But, the Asian nations are fast catching up and may in reality have already surpassed it. So, let the bamboo represent the No. 2 currencies (the yen, etc.). The reverse order (bamboo on top and the dollar on the bottom) is really a look at the future.	Bamboo bling is the newest Asian Rapper, No. 1 on the charts right now.	3	1	ダイ、テイ

Snare is a little generic so I´ll use BEAR TRAP, with huge teeth cartoon style that snares you around the ankle. In the crafting of a bear trap, one must be particularly adroit.

1331	decay	Hủ (bất hủ)	朽	decay, tree, wood, snare	6	33	Tree . . . snare. Do not confuse with rot (Frame 1099).		This snare isn´t terribly effective, because it´s swinging from a decaying tree. Imagine the tree as being so decayed that when an animal gets caught in the snare, its struggles cause the tree to collapse into a putrid mess.	枯 wither The decay of an animal in the TREE was from something caught in a SNARE.

1335	bestow, ban cho	Dự	与	bestow, slingshot, catapult, one	3	33	Slingshot . . . one. Later we shall learn the character for give (Frame 2046), but even so, it is a good idea already at this point to distinguish this key word from impart (Frame 795) and grant (Frame 1131).		David went to battle with a slingshot and it only took him one shot to slay Goliath. Partly because of this, the prophet Nathan was later instructed to bestow upon David the throne of all Israel.	In The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, one of the first weapons bestowed on Link was the slingshot.	JH	3	ヨ	あた.える、あずか.る、くみ.する、ともに	与える (あた.える)
1336	copy	Tả	写	copy, crown, bestow, slingshot, catapult, one	5	33	Crown . . . bestow.		A crown was bestowed to the British royalty museum, but it was only a copy.	True fact: in the UK the right to print a copy of the KJV Bible is bestowed by the crown -- there are only a few authorised bible printers.

1337	somebody	Thân	身	somebody, nose	7	34	The key word somebody was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the nose (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for oneself). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of somebody with a prominent paunch.		Somebody was just looking for you. He had a longnose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face. (greenapple,16-3-2006) The way to remember that this is somebody rather than someone (#1256) is that the story is full of body descriptions.	Somebody was just looking for you. He had a long nose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face.	3		シン	み	身 (み)
1338	shoot	Xạ	射	shoot, somebody, nose, glue	10	34	"""I shot an arrow into the air, And it landed I know not where"" goes the poem. (The poor poet obviously loses a lot of arrows.)

1340	old man	Lão	老	old man, old man, soil, dirt, ground, spoon, sitting on the ground	6	34	"First, do not confuse this character with venerable old man (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an old man begins with an abbreviation of the character for somebody, the nose having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the soil drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when ""dust to dust"" begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal walking stick for getting around; and the spoon for being spoon-fed."	* As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements.	An old man, wondering what it´s like in a grave, sits in a freshly dug plot. When a gravekeeper mistakes him for dead and begins burying him with soil, the old man saves himself by flailing his walking stick in the air.	Old man sits in the dirt, having a stroke.	4	3	ロウ	お.いる、ふ.ける	老いる (お.いる), 老ける (ふ.ける)
1341	consider	Khảo	考	consider, old man, slingshot, catapult	6	34	Old man . . . slingshot. Remember: you already have kanji for discriminating (Frame 521), deliberation (Frame 692), and think (Frame 651).		Before shooting an old man with a slingshot, one shold carefully consider the possible consequences.	Even though he had the old man Mr. Wilson within the sights of his slingshot, Dennis the Menace considered what he was doing and stopped.	2	4	コウ	かんが.える、かんが.え	考える (かんが.える)
1342	filial piety	Hiếu	孝	filial piety, old man, child	7	34	Old man . . . child.		This child has taken filial piety to the next level. He is actually carrying the old man on his shoulders.	+dilandau23: This child has taken filial piety to the next level. He is actually carrying the old man on his shoulders. There is a picture of a statue depicting this here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety.	6		コウ、キョウ		
1343	teach	Giáo	教	teach, filial piety, old man, child, taskmaster	11	34	Filial piety . . . taskmaster.		In early Japan, filial piety was the cornerstone of education, and harsh taskmasters were employed to teach it.	"You could say that the taskmistress is teaching you filial piety when she whips you and asks, ""Who´s your daddy?!""."	2	4	キョウ	おし.える、おそ.わる	教える (おし.える), 教わる (おそ.わる)
1344	torture	Khảo (tra khảo, tra tấn)	拷	torture, finger, fingers, consider, old man, slingshot, catapult	9	34	Fingers . . . consider.		In Torture 101 class they teach you to Consider the Fingers as the first part to inflict pain to. Then you can move on to other parts (like feet, groin, head, etc. etc. ; ) ).	"Aaaargh, stop! cries the victim of torture, his fingers being squeezed by the thumb screws. ""I´ll consider it,"" the torturer says coolly, ""if you tell me the names of all the agents in your organization.""."	JH	1	ゴウ		
1345	someone	Giả (học giả, độc giả)	者	someone, puppet, sooty, old man, sun, day	8	34	"Old man . . . sun. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to somebody. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun ""something."""	* As a primitive it means a puppet-on-a-string.	I find the best way of memorizing this kanji is in conjunction with the Japanese compound for ninja: 忍者 -- i.e. someone who endures (see FRAME 597 for the kanji 忍). A 忍者 is not just a 身 (somebody), it´s 者 who can 忍 great 拷!	Back in the day, the old man used to be someone. His name was in the papers and all that. I use CHUCKY from the movie Child´s Play as my major alternate meaning for this primitive.	3	4	シャ	もの	者 (もの)

So i thought of ""voodoo doll"" but then found ""love doll"" (which is just a special type of puppet) fit well with these 8 frames. Observe: Here I am boiling my love doll over the flames to warm her up a bit..."	There is a lesser known voodoo practice of boiling a puppet over an oven fire, to really make your victim feel the heat!	JH	1	シャ	に.る、-に、に.える、に.やす	煮える (に.える), 煮やす (に.やす), 煮る (に.る)

You have trouble squeezing your hand through the hole so you use a saw to enlarge it.

I call the 1st pattern ""Miss World"" (who is wearing a crown & has long human legs) and the 2nd ""garter"" (one human leg passes through the crown wearing it as a garter). Story: Miss World has climbed a tree to avoid the finger that was groping for her. (探 means ""grope for"", i.e. search)."

1427	hill	Khưu	丘	hill, axe, one, floor	5	35	Since this supposedly pictographic representation of a hill looks like anything but, picture a row of axes driven into the ground up to their heads, and see if that doesn't present a more memorable image of hill - at least a riskier one sliding down!		Excalibur is the sword planted in a rock. Lesser known AXCAHILLBUR is the axe planted on top of a hill.	At Capitol Hill proposals get axed on the floor.	JH	1	キュウ	おか	丘 (おか)
1428	Point	Nhạc (núi cao)	岳	point, hill, axe, one, floor, mountain	8	35	Think of the key word as referring to proper names of mountains, but do not confuse with mountain pass (Frame 835). The elements are: hill . . . mountain.		A point is a extra little hill at the top of a mountain. We´ll call it ´Fireman´s Point´.	This actually means a high mountain. So, to cater to the keyword, it´s surely obvious (ahem) that if something gets such a fine title as Point, it must be more magnificent than the average mountain. It´s as if there was a hill on top of an average mountain, adding to its height.	JH	1	ガク	たけ	岳 (たけ)

1431	thread	Mịch	糸	thread, spiderman	6	36	Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the elbows and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here thread) while she rolled it up into a little ball? Now can you see the two elbows (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for little below?		I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I´ve opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as dainty (#1363) and accumulate (#1364).	You´ll be seeing this one a lot. Seriously.	1	2	シ	いと	糸 (いと)

After a day being virtuouos and keeping the city safe, Spiderman´s outfit is in need of some repair. Luckily, as he can shoot out threads darning is very easy for him to do.	Darning is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair. And obviously, repairing someones broken cloth things is a virtuous thing to do, and you need thread to do it.

1440	tighten	Đế (buộc, ràng buộc)	締	tighten, thread, spiderman, sovereign, vase, stand up, apron, crown, towel	15	36	Thread . . . sovereign.		The sovereign appears to be ruling, but in reality someone behind him (for instance his wife) has a thread around his throat, and if he dares to make a decision she doesn´t like, she starts pulling the thread and tightens it around his throat.	(astridtops) Spiderman managed to get behind the sovereign. (pick your favourite nowadays country ruler who isn´t doing a good job). Spidey has tightend a web around the sovereing´s throat. As long as the sovereign says what spidey whispers, he will be fine.

"Ok, here, you have to think of the phrase ""TIE the knot"" , which means a wedding (this kanji is used in the marriage compound 結婚 けっこん ).

At his wedding, Spider THREAD attached (or TIED) to SPRAYCANS are being drug behind the limo as they drive off."	Spiderman and a fan have a competition to see who can tie up the most enemies fastest.

He's about to get it out, when you manage to stop the spoon from getting out, so he turns purple, as he chokes, and dies.	Why is your ass purple?

Spidey received good word that the acupuncturist working down the road was actually the evil Doctor Octopus! Spidey headed over to the clinic, and trussed the acupuncturist Doc Oc up using the maniac´s own metal limbs!	Because people are so afraid of the procedure, string has to be used by the acunpunturist to truss up his victims, er, patients.	JH	1	バク	しば.る	縛る (しば.る)
1477	straw rope	Thằng	縄	straw rope, thread, spiderman, eels, sun, day	15	36	Thread . . . eels.		"The tortoise has escaped! We tied it up with a straw rope, but all that´s left of the rope are some torn threads, and the unbound tortoise is nowhere to be found. (Note that the right half here is not ""eels"". This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in waterfall (#537) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as ""eels"". It is much better to call the right half of this character an ""unbound tortoise"".)."	When Spiderman fights the giant tortoise, he grabs a straw rope from the edges of the sumo ring and swings it at his head. However, the tortoise quickly tucks his head back into his shell to avoid the blow (hence no head on the tortoise).	JH	1	ジョウ	なわ、ただ.す	縄 (なわ)
1478	infancy	Ấu	幼	infancy, cocoon, power, muscle, arnold	5	36	Cocoon . . . muscle.		In its infancy, a butterfly is protected by a cocoon, as it doesn´t yet have any power of its own.

1481	how many	Kỷ, ky	幾	how many, cocoon, person, fiesta, cocoon2	12	36	Two cocoons . . . person . . . fiesta.	* As a primitive, this kanji will mean an abacus, the bead-instrument used in the Orient to calculate how many.	It is a little awkward when you are at a fiesta and the host serves some rare delicacy, like moth cocoons, the guests must decide how many it would be polite to eat. You do the math in your head and it comes out to two cocoons per person. This is why the horizontal line is a fraction bar with two cocoons on the top, and one person the bottom.	How many went to the party? Two aliens and one person (I feel sorry for that person).	JH	3	キ	いく-、いく.つ、いく.ら	幾 (いく)
1482	mechanism	Cơ	機	mechanism, tree, wood, abacus, how many, cocoon, person, fiesta, cocoon2	16	36	Tree . . . abacus.		An abacus is a mechanism made of wood used to calculate how many ´anythings´.	"To avoid confusing with contraption (#677), focus on the ""ism"" of mechanism. For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish; mechanism here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable tree (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching abacus that smashes enemies between its giant beads."	4	3	キ	はた	機 (はた)

1488	hug	Ủng	擁	hug, finger, fingers, mysterious, top hat, cocoon, turkey	16	36	Fingers . . . mysterious . . . turkey. Note that the top hat is extended across both elements, though it belongs only to the cocoon. This means that you may either use mysterious - as we did here - or take the three elements separately.		Imagine Gandalf hugging a turkey....ouch! It bit off his finger!	A mysterious turkey with human fingers wants to hug me... I will never go to Tokyo Disneyland again!	JH	1	ヨウ		
1489	nourishing	Tư	滋	nourishing, water, water droplets, water pistol, double-mysterious, mothballs, horns, one, cocoon, cocoon2	12	36	Water . . . double-mysterious. Note the doubling up of the element for top hat in the primitive for mysterious and assign it a special image, as it will come up in the next two frames.		Water is doubly mysterious. It´s in all our nourishment...and yet, it´s really not nourishing at all.	Going off the idea of the right side meaning rapid growth/increase of small objects, I´ve decided to make the right side be Gremlins, those little mysterious creatures that double rapidly. Gremlins find water a little too nourishing, as it makes them instantly multiply.	JH	1	ジ		
1490	mercy	Từ	慈	mercy, double-mysterious, mothballs, horns, one, cocoon, heart, cocoon2	13	36	Double-mysterious . . . heart.		Mercy comes from the doubly mysterious heart of God.	Here we see the DOUBLE-MYSTERIOUS Siamese twins again, at the MERCY of the machines that pump blood through their veins, since the single HEART they share won´t do the job...

Turns out the stones were magnetic, and they weren´t siamese twins at all!	6	1	ジ		
1492	lineage	Hệ	系	lineage, stick, drop, thread, spiderman	7	36	The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for thread gives the image of threads woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, lineage. [7]	* As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of yarn, as the uniting of many threads into a single strand is most obvious with yarn.	(Primitive: DNA, a drop of looong spiraled thread that is the key to your lineage).	Spiderman´s lineage (who his family is etc...) can be found in his DNA in a drop of blood. The villain that gets blood of Spidey will be able to find out who is family and lineage is. be carfefull spidey...	6	1	ケイ		
1493	person in charge	Hệ (Quan hệ)	係	person in charge, person, lineage, drop, thread, spiderman	9	36	Person . . . yarn.

The prefecture has suspended all DNA research for heart disease because of corruption. All involved will be suspended by their wrists.

If you tried to attach money to an envelope to pay for postage it would be GONE before it arrived at the post office. That´s why we use STAMPS instead.	JH	1	キャク	かえ.って、しりぞ.く、しりぞ.ける	
1498	shins	Cước	脚	skids, shins, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, instead, gone, soil, dirt, ground, elbow, stamp	11	37	Part of the body . . . instead. This character has more or less the same meaning as that for leg learned back in frame 1372. It can also indicate the part of the legs from the shins down, which explains the choice of the key word.		Shins are the part of the body that one uses instead of one´s eyes, for finding furniture in the dark. (Ouch!).	Shins are the part of the body that Japanese traditionally sit on instead of their asses.	JH	1	キャク、キャ、カク	あし	脚部 (きゃくぶ), 脚本 (きゃくほん), 三脚 (さんきゃく), 脚 (あし)

To the right, the stamp.		Selling WHOLESALE HORSES over the internet had to be STOPPED because the cost of STAMPS was too much.	If you need horseshoes (shoes that fit your horse´s footprint), buy them at the wholesale shop. They lick and paste stamps in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.

1501	clothing	Phục	服	clothing, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, underpants, stamp, crotch	8	37	Flesh . . . stamp . . . crotch. Note how the stamp is stretched out here.		It´s customary to cover the flesh with clothing, but some designs are so outrageous they´re not bigger than a stamp that just covers your crotch.	Modern clothing shows a lot of flesh -- some is practically no more than a postage stamp covering your crotch!	3	4	フク		
1502	fate	Mệnh	命	fate, fit, meeting, umbrella, one, mouth, stamp	8	37	This character connotes life in general, but also the particular life that is fated one by virtue of the distinctive character with which one is born. Its elements are: fit . . . stamp. The bottom portion of fit is nudged to the left in order to make room for the stamp.		When you´re born, your fate is measured, fitted, and stamped onto your soul.

As everyone started to leave, the general exclaims ""Oh wait! I need to certify these orders!"" and went around stamping each paper with his personal chop-seal."	These are your orders, declares the general at the meeting as he stamps them with his chop-seal. (Primitive: chop-seal imaged as a papal ring, the one´s they would press into wax as their official seal. Also a cattle brand.).	4	2	レイ		
1504	zero	Linh	零	zero, rain, weather, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko	13	37	Rain . . . orders.		The amount of people that can order the rain to rain.	Despite the rain, the zero pilot flies on. He has kamikaze orders.	JH	2	レイ	ぜろ、こぼ.す、こぼ.れる

You know you are fast approaching a ripe old AGE when you get ORDERS from the dentist to get new TEETH.	This has the nuance of a life milestone. Here it's represented by the life-cycle of teeth: In childhood, your teeth give the orders, growing whenever they want. As a teenager, we give orders to the teeth, by putting braces on them. In old age, we order new teeth!	JH	2	レイ	よわ.い、とし	
1506	cool	Lãnh (lạnh)	冷	cool, ice, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko	7	37	Ice . . . orders.		To keep your water cool, just order some ice.	The Japanese boss gives an order at the meeting: eat ice to stay cool (since they won´t be running the air conditioning anymore).	4	3	レイ	つめ.たい、ひ.える、ひ.や、ひ.ややか、ひ.やす、ひ.やかす、さ.める、さ.ます	冷ます (さ.ます), 冷める (さ.める), 冷たい (つめ.たい), 冷える (ひ.える), 冷や (ひ.や), 冷やかす (ひ.やかす), 冷やす (ひ.やす)
1507	jurisdiction	Lãnh, lĩnh	領	jurisdiction, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	14	37	Orders . . . head.		Two cowboys are crossing a state limit. One says to him “Did you know that in this Jurisdiction there are Orders to get your head?”, so he takes out his gun and shoots him. He claims the reward afterwards. (Thanks Fuaburisu).	Orders are given by the head person in any jurisdiction.	5	2	リョウ	えり	
1508	small bell	Linh	鈴	small bell, metal, gold, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko	13	37	Gold . . . orders.		Some restaurants have a small gold bell to call someone to take customers´ orders.

1509	courage	Dũng	勇	courage, chop-seal, hanko, male, rice field, brains, power, muscle, arnold	9	37	Chop-seal . . . man.		I imagined some kind of initiation rite in old China, where every young man has to show his courage. They then receive a chopseal which is a mark of their courage.	Re: fuaburisu - The initiation rite in question is actually a reverse elbow chop to the brain, and you receive the chop seal if you have the power to withstand it. This initial imagery helps me with the altered chop seal and vertical placement.	4	2	ユウ	いさ.む	勇む (いさ.む)
1511	traffic	Thông	通	traffic, pogo stick, chop-seal, hanko, utilise, utilize, road	10	37	Chop-seal . . . utilize . . . road. By combining the first two primitives into a single image, you will be able to use that image in a few instances later, one of which comes immediately.		I bounce down the road on my pogo stick, easily getting through the dense traffic. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a chop-seal is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could utilize it as a pogo stick). [Edit: pogo stick also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].	Building on gorgon´s story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the traffic. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge chopseal that they utilize to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the road.	2	4	ツウ、ツ	とお.る、とお.り、-とお.り、-どお.り、とお.す、とお.し、-どお.し、かよ.う	通行 (つうこう), 通読 (つうどく), 普通 (ふつう), 通う (かよ.う), 通す (とお.す), 通る (とお.る)

The winner of the long jump competition was disqualified when they found he used a pogo stick tied to his leg to jump further.	"The high jumper has his wooden leg fitted with a pogo stick, and can now jump even higher. (See my note at traffic (#1408) for pogo stick). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword ""jump"" leads to confusion later on (see cjon256´s post), ""Dancing"" would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from dance (#1774)). New Story: I was no good at dancing due to my wooden leg... until I had it fitted with a pogo stick!"	JH	2	ヨウ	おど.る	踊り (おど.り), 踊る (おど.る)

A very doubtful story: At the entrance to my local zoo they issue you with a special spoon (to feed the animals) and a dart gun (to defend yourself in case of animal attack). You must then hanko (seal) a document to say you’ve received both these items, only after which will they let you enter the zoo.

1516	pattern	Phạm (phạm vi, mô phạm, phép, khuôn mẫu)	範	pattern, bamboo, car, fingerprint	15	37	Bamboo . . . car . . . fingerprint.		This pattern made of bamboo is for a new model of car designed to leave as small an ecological fingerprint as possible.	I just had a new bamboo-leaf pattern spray-painted on my car.

1517	crime	Phạm	犯	crime, pack of wild dogs, fingerprint	5	37	Wild dogs . . . fingerprint.		Crimes can often be solved using the tools of dogs and fingerprints.

1519	unlucky	Ách (tai ách, khổ ách, khổ sở)	厄	unlucky, cliff, fingerprint	4	37	Cliff . . . fingerprint.		Seeing some finger prints at the edge of a cliff, I wondered who that unlucky person was.	Sherlock Holmes is very unlucky: he just fell off a cliff while he was looking around for fingerprints.	JH	1	ヤク		
1520	dangerous	Nguy	危	dangerous, bound up, unlucky, cliff, fingerprint	6	37	Bound up . . . unlucky.		If you live a dangerous life, eventually you're bound to get unlucky.	While rock climbing you are bound to the cliff by just your fingerprints, which is why it´s so dangerous.	6	3	キ	あぶ.ない、あや.うい、あや.ぶむ	危ない (あぶ.ない), 危うい (あや.うい), 危ぶむ (あや.ぶむ)
1521	address	Uyển	宛	address, house, mailbox, evening, fingerprint	8	37	House . . . mailbox.		Your address should be displayed on your house and mailbox.	For the primitive: This is a hi-tech Japanese mailbox, it automatically lights up in the evening, and has a biometric fingerprint scanner. --- Each house´s address, even if it´s hard to see in the evening, is like its own unique fingerprint.	JH		エン	あ.てる、-あて、-づつ、あたか.も	宛てる (あ.てる)
1522	arm	Oản (Cánh tay)	腕	arm, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, address, house, mailbox, evening, fingerprint	12	37	Part of the body . . . address.		Like in Memento, I tattoo my address on my forearm flesh so I don´t forget it.

1523	garden	Uyển	苑	garden, flowers, mailbox, evening, fingerprint	8	37	Flowers . . . mailbox.		"Japanese ""gardens"" aren´t anything more than a pot of flowers on top of the mailbox."	My mailbox is actually right in the middle of my garden, which kind of sucks since the mailman has to trample all my flowers to get to it.	Names	1	エン、オン	その、う.つ	
1524	grudge	Oán	怨	grudge, mailbox, evening, fingerprint, heart	9	37	Mailbox . . . heart.		I couldn´t drop my grudge against him. So I put a severed pig´s heart in his mailbox. He got the message.

1525	willow	Liêu	柳	willow, tree, wood, blown eggs, sign of the hare, receipt, stamp	9	37	Tree . . . receipt . . . stamp.		Having decided to use SIGN OF THE HARE rather than RECEIPT and STAMP my mnemonic goes as follows: The WILLOW is the TREE that droops likes a HARE´s ears.

1527	detain	Lưu	留	detain, receipt, sword, dagger, rice field, brains	10	37	Receipt . . . dagger . . . rice field.		The use of RANSOM NOTE (think of a receipt with a dagger through it on a door) works great with DETAIN. Here the RANSOM NOTE says that the girl has been DETAINED in an undisclosed location. To get her back take the RANSOM to a empty FIELD.	Got a receipt for that dagger, son? If not, we´re going to detain you and send you to work in the rice fields.	5	3	リュウ、ル	と.める、と.まる、とど.める、とど.まる、るうぶる	留意 (りゅうい), 留学 (りゅうがく), 保留 (ほりゅう), 留まる (と.まる), 留める (と.める)
1529	trade	Mậu (Mậu dịch, trao đổi)	貿	trade, receipt, sword, dagger, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	12	37	Receipt . . . dagger . . . shells. Though the meanings are related, do not confuse with make a deal (Frame 471) or wholesale (Frame 1499).		There´s a buyback program where you can trade in your dagger for money. But it´s quite ineffective, since only registered dagger-owners with the original receipts can participate, and not criminals with illegally-purchased daggers.	The new RANSOM note (a receipt stuck to a door with a dagger) from DETAIN (1423) appears again (probably after you went to the field as instructed) now gives instruction to TRADE the victim for CURRENCY you were told to bring.	5	2	ボウ		
1530	stamp	Ấn	印	stamp, staples, stamp	6	37	At last we come to the general character meaning stamp. Its elements: staples . . . stamp.		Before sticky backs, they had to staple stamps to letters.	Aaaagh, this old stamp doesn´t stick! Okay I´ll just staple it.	4	2	イン	しるし、-じるし、しる.す	印 (しるし)
1533	entertain	Hưng (hứng)	興	entertain, staples, same, monks, hood, one, mouth, tool, animal legs, eight	16	37	Mortar . . . same . . . tool. Be careful to make an image that keeps same in the middle.		To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be entertained. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the same: staples. What tools! [ayoung24].	Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) -- all this as a tool to entertain a group of drunks at a club.	5	1	コウ、キョウ	おこ.る、おこ.す	興行 (こうぎょう), 復興 (ふっこう), 振興 (しんこう), 興す (おこ.す), 興る (おこ.る)
1534	sign of the bird	Dậu (con gà)	酉	sign of the bird, whiskey bottle, west, one	7	38	Though we shall later encounter the kanji for bird, we introduce this one for the tenth sign of the zodiac mainly because of its use as a primitive, where it has a different meaning.	"* As a primitive, it means whiskey bottle. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about one-third full). You might also think of the Spanish ""porrón,"" a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird."	The sign of the bird on this whiskey bottle is of course the Famous Grouse blended Scotch.	"Normally birds fly south, but one bird flew west. People were worried about it and kept asking ""Is there any sign of the bird – you know, the one that flew west?""."	Names	1	ユウ	とり	
1535	saké	Tửu	酒	sake, water, water droplets, water pistol, whiskey bottle	10	38	Water . . . whiskey bottle.		Sake is just watered down whisky.	Sake is the generic term for alcohol (not just japanese rice wine). And a very popular alcoholic drink in Japan is whiskey and water.	3	3	シュ	さけ、さか-	酒 (さけ)
1536	bartending	Chước	酌	bartending, whiskey bottle, ladle	10	38	Whiskey bottle . . . ladle.		At the local pub, their bartending practises are unusual. They serve the whiskey by pouring it from a ladle, like one would from the punch bowl.	Ever seen the anime Bartender? Bartending isn´t just about bottles of whiskey, it´s about ladling out advice.	JH	1	シャク	く.む	酌む (く.む)
1538	fermentation	Giếu, diếu	酵	fermentation, whiskey bottle, filial piety, old man, child	14	38	Whiskey bottle . . . filial piety.		The secrets of fermentation are passed to the son who displays the most filial piety.	Since filial piety is all about respecting ones elders, and the older a whiskey bottle is (i.e. the time it have spent undergoing fermentation) the more respect you should give it, the meaning of this kanji becomes clear. If it doesn´t, sink back some whiskey and it will.	JH	1	コウ		
1539	cruel	Khốc	酷	cruel, whiskey bottle, revelation, cow, mouth	14	38	Whiskey bottle . . . revelation.		It´s cruel to pour alcohol down a cow´s mouth.

1541	dairy products	Lạc	酪	dairy products, whiskey bottle, each, walking legs, mouth	13	38	Whiskey bottle . . . each.		"Imagine if at each supermarket you went to, the section for dairy products was next to the alcohol aisle. so for each wheel of cheese you decide to buy, you get an accompanying bottle of wine...perfect for a ""wine & cheese"" party. :)."	In an attempt to increase sales of dairy products, the grocery store is giving away a free miniature whiskey bottle with each dairy product you buy.	JH	1	ラク		
1542	vinegar	Tạc	酢	vinegar, whiskey bottle, saw	12	38	Whiskey bottle . . . saw.		Drinking alcohol that´s turned to vinegar feels like a saw going down your throat.	I spent ages sawing that whiskey bottle open, but when I got in, it had all turned to vinegar!	JH	1	サク	す	酢 (す)
1543	drunk	Tuý	酔	drunk, whiskey bottle, ninety, nine, baseball, ten, needle	11	38	Whiskey bottle . . . baseball . . . needle.		God you´re drunk! How many whiskeys did you have? 9? 10?	Whiskey with 90 percent alcohol will get you drunk. I don´t care who you are.	JH	1	スイ	よ.う、よ.い、よ	酔う (よ.う)
1544	distribute	Phối	配	distribute, whiskey bottle, snake, self	10	38	Whisky bottle . . . snake.		To DISTRIBUTE WHISKY during Prohibition you had to be as sneaky as a SNAKE.	I imagine a bartender serving whiskey to his patrons, and using that snake-like sprayer to distribute soda water into each glass.	3	3	ハイ	くば.る	配る (くば.る)
1545	acid	Toan	酸	acid, whiskey bottle, streetwalker, Ministry of silly walks, John Cleese, license, elbow, human legs, walking legs	14	38	Whiskey bottle . . . license . . . walking legs.		The prostitute carries an old whiskey bottle filled with acid to throw at any difficult Johns.	Dealing alcohol requires a license, dealing acid requires fast legs (to run from the police).	5	1	サン	す.い	酸い (す.い)
1546	waver	Do (do dự)	猶	furthermore, waver, pack of wild dogs, chieftain, Molotov cocktail, animal horns, whiskey bottle	12	38	Wild dogs . . . animal horns . . . whiskey bottle.		The waver for this kanji means to hesitate. I wavered before going into the bar with a bunch of horned wild dogs drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle.	I wavered when the pack of wild dogs was blocking the way, but then I drank some Red Bull and charged through. (thanks shakkun).	JH	1	ユウ、ユ	なお	
1547	revered	Tôn	尊	revered, chieftain, Molotov cocktail, animal horns, whiskey bottle, glue	12	38	Animal horns . . . whiskey bottle . . . glue.		I drank the Devil Whiskey and was revered by all. Too bad I had to have my anus glued shut from the damage it did to my digestive system...

1548	beans	Đậu	豆	beans, table, one, mouth	7	38	This kanji depicts a pot of beans, although it looks more like a table on which the pot is resting.	* As a primitive, this kanji will mean table.	If I eat BEANS, after ONE MOUTHful I fart like some kind of HORNED ANIMAL.	I hate using primitives that are completely unrelated. Let´s call this one Mr. Bean! He´s an easy character to build stories with.	3	1	トウ、ズ	まめ、まめ-	豆腐 (とうふ), 納豆 (なっとう), 豆 (まめ)
1549	head	Đầu	頭	head, beans, table, one, mouth, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	16	38	Here we meet at last the full kanji on which the primitive for head is based.

1550	short	Đoản	短	short, dart, drop, heavens, beans, table, one, mouth	12	38	Dart . . . table.		He is so short so he has to throw darts from the table.	Sort of like ping pong, this kanji represents a game where you throw darts over a table at your opponent. The serve is rarely returned, so the games tend to be short.------------ This character apparently refers to duration, not just to height.	3	2	タン	みじか.い	短い (みじか.い)
1551	bountiful	Phong (phong phú)	豊	bountiful, bend, beans, table, one, mouth	13	38	Bend . . . table. Think of a bountiful harvest, and you will not be far from the meaning of this character.

1552	drum	Cố	鼓	drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, branch, ten, needle, crotch	13	38	The full kanji for the drum adds a branch, apparently to serve as a drumstick, to the primitive for drum.		Japanese festivals have drums so big, a samurai has to SIT (not stand) on a table to beat one with a tree branch! http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/~hidafyh/furukawayh/gyouji/image/maturi03.jpg.	"I really hate the primitive meaning of ""table"" for ""bean."" I just use ""bean."" Anyways, for the DRUM primitive, imagine a SAMURAI who beats on a DRUM with two chopsticks, and a BEAN skewered on each end of the chopstick to produce a better sound. And the obvious story is: ""DRUMing on a DRUM with a huge BRANCH""."	JH	1	コ	つづみ	鼓 (つづみ)
1553	rejoice	Hỷ, hỉ	喜	rejoice, drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, mouth, mouth2	12	38	Drum . . . mouth.		The samurai sitting on the drum is on a stage, and the people below him are rejoicing with their mouths in unison. It helps me to imagine the placement this way.	In the taiko (drum (#1444)) song of rejoicing, the drummers shout with open mouths.	4	3	キ	よろこ.ぶ、よろこ.ばす	喜ぶ (よろこ.ぶ)
1554	timber-trees	Thụ (cây, cổ thụ)	樹	timber-trees, tree, wood, drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, glue	16	38	Trees . . . drum . . . glue.		The hippies object to trees being cut down for timber. They have glued themselves to the timber-trees and are beating their drums.	"Everyone likes to see big trees fall down.

1555	dish	Mãnh	皿	dish	5	38	The kanji for a dish is, clearly, the pictograph of a painted or carved bowl, seen from the side.		Three dishes stacked side-by-side in a dishwasher.	Pictograph of a dish with a three-layer cake slice on it.	3	2	ベイ	さら	皿 (さら)
1556	blood	Huyết	血	blood, drop, dish	6	38	The drop in the dish is blood. It is similar to the drop we saw earlier on the dagger in the character for blade (Frame 88).		You cut yourself washing the dishes, drop of blood.	Image: Holy Grail with a drop of Jesus blood on it.	3	2	ケツ	ち	血 (ち)
1557	basin	Bồn	盆	basin, part, eight, sword, dagger, dish	9	38	Part . . . dish.		The part of the kitchen sink in which you wash dishes in is the basin.	I'm not an expert, but it seems that as a basin this refers more to an oceanic basin that a kitchen one, and in any case seems most common in reference to the famous O-Bon festival. So, a story: in the O-Bon festival, so many dishes are broken that all the parts have to be thrown into a deep oceanic basin.	JH	1	ボン		
1558	alliance	Minh (đồng minh)	盟	alliance, bright, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, dish	13	38	Bright . . . dish.		In order to form alliances, you should sit down for a meal and eat until your dish is bright or clear; in other words, get to know people first, before you talk business.	"A new alliance is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their alliance they clean up together one dish, and present it to the photographers. The clean dish under the flash lights appears very bright, and it´s pretty much all you can see on the photo that appears on the next morning´s newspapers, with the title ""New alliance, one bright dish!""."	6	1	メイ		
1559	steal	Đạo	盗	steal, next, ice, lack, yawn, dish	11	38	Next . . . dish.		You are so poor you dont know where your next dish will come from all you know is that you will have to steal it.	The first thing to steal is the silverware; next, the dishes.	JH	3	トウ	ぬす.む、ぬす.み	盗む (ぬす.む)
1560	warm	Ôn	温	warm, water, water droplets, water pistol, sun, day, dish	12	38	Water . . . sun . . . dish.		If you leave water out in the sun in a dish, naturally it will get warm.	To distinguish from warmth (#1949), which refers to warm weather, remember that this means warm objects or feelings. Imagine a plastic kiddy pool in the backyard full of lukewarm water. The kiddy pool is shaped like a huge dish, and it's been under the sun all day - that's why the water is warm now.	3	2	オン	あたた.か、あたた.かい、あたた.まる、あたた.める、ぬく	温か (あたた.か), 温かい (あたた.かい), 温まる (あたた.まる), 温める (あたた.める)

In the old days, salt was a worth alot, so it is not surprising to find someone reclining on the ground, mouth to plate, getting every last grain of that delicious salt.	"The eccentric explorer lay down on the earth 土, opened his mouth 口, and licked it. ""As I suspected!"" he said, ""It's salt. Something to spice up our dishes 皿 with!"""	4	2	エン	しお	塩 (しお)
1569	silver	Ngân	銀	silver, metal, gold, silver	14	38	Metal . . . silver.		Like gold, silver is a metal.	Not sure why Heisig find the right side so troublesome. My grandma´s hairpin (just before long (#1920)) is made of silver, the metal that best reflects sun light. I´m sure you can see the flash from her hair as she walks by on a sunny day. Note that the two elements (sun and hairpin) share not only a horizontal stroke, but also the left vertical one. Therefore a bit odd stroke order.	3	4	ギン	しろがね	
1570	resentment	Hận	恨	regret, resentment, Freud, state of mind, silver	9	38	State of mind . . . silver.		The athlete´s state of mind is nothing but resentment after getting the silver medal.

1578	good	Lương	良	good, drop, silver	7	38	Drop of . . . silver.	* As a primitive, use the image of a saint's halo.

Keep your connotation distinct from Inst. (Frame 1401) when working with the elements: food . . . bureaucrat.		This Bldg. is like all the other government buildings - they house bureaucrats who sit around sipping wine and eating expensive meals at the taxpayers expense.

Think of previously as ""the previous customer"" in a restaurant. At a cheap sleazy diner, the waitress gives you unwashed silverware that was previously used by the previous customer. Yuck."

1594	outline	Khái (khái quát)	概	outline, roots, tree, wood, silver, waitress, previously	14	38	Roots . . . waitress. Note that the kanji meaning of the two primitives to the right is not used here because we shall later meet a primitive meaning beforehand and want to preempt any confusion. The same holds true in the following frame.		The police tried to draw a chalk outline around the dead waitress, but it was kinda tough with all the tree roots underneath her.	If you attempted to outline the biography of most famous actresses, you´d find that they have roots working as waitresses before getting their big break.	JH	1	ガイ	おうむ.ね

1596	even	Bình (bình đẳng)	平	even, water-lily, lily pad	5	39	This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of even.

Finally, I´m about to fight him. But what´s this? He´s suspiciously quiet. I move to attack him, and his right arm falls off at the elbow. Strange. I walk up to him and detach his left arm. Very strange. I undo his belt, and take off his top hat... BLAST! It was just a decoy turkey!	The left side isn't too hard---a top-hatted villain whose villainy involves belts around elbows?

Its elements: pinnacle . . . rice seedlings . . . ground."		My rice-seedlings have become sentient and will go on a mission. I can only apologise for the next 6 frames. In the distance, there is a pinnacle, which the newly-awakened rice-seedlings who are still stuck in the ground can see. Could it be the Promised Land?

"Heat up those RICE SEEDLINGS you pulled from the SOIL in a ROUND pan over a low FLAME. (Note: the hot pan image helps reinforce the idea that this kanji for ""atsui"" refers to something hot to the touch, as opposed to hot weather)."	"Just a comment on Erikkusan's story: Although one of the pronunciations of this kanji is ""atsui"" this isn't the atsui that you feel in Tokyo in August, (which is Frame 1260's ""sultry' 暑). This atsui is the one when you touch something hot, like a fry pan.

1637	sign of the hog	Hợi (Chi thứ 12, heo)	亥	sign of the hog, acorn, top hat	6	39	This kanji is the 12th sign of the Chinese zodiac: the sign of the hog. It is best learned by thinking of an acorn-eating hog in connection with the primitive meaning given below.	* The top hat represents the external shape of the acorn, and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an elbow and person) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the acorn contains the oak tree in a nutshell.	A greedy hog in a top hat who has eaten all of the acorns. He even elbows people out of the way to get them.

This famous ninja (I always use ninjas with sabres, distinct from samurai) used to engrave the kanji for his name onto acorns, and throw the acorns to distract his enemies.

While it´s traditional for lovers to engrave their names on a tree in many countries, in Japan, however, it was traditional for a samurai to signify his undying love for a woman by engraving the kanji of her name on an acorn with his sabre.	6	3	コク	きざ.む、きざ.み	刻む (きざ.む)

Don't mix up with cool (#1404), when the cool boys order each other around. This kind of cold has to do with weather. When its cold outside, I stay at home and have hot celery soup with chicken legs to keep out the ice. 寒い　＝　さむい　＝cold.	Some strange animal tried to steal a stalk of celery from my house. However, it was freezing and the floor was covered in ice, so the mysterious animal couldn´t get any traction.

1658	clear up	Tình (trong xanh, tạnh, lúc không mưa gọi là tình)	晴	clear up, sun, day, blue, grow up, moon, flesh	12	40	Take the key word in its associations with the weather (unless that tempts you to include the primitive for weather, which doesn't belong here). Its elements: sun . . . blue.		Sun and blue sky! Yep, the weather´s cleared up!	When we speak of clearing up we easily think of both the sun and blue skies. But in another since to clear up is the absence of weather. And therefor the reason weather has no place in its writing.	2	3	セイ	は.れる、は.れ、は.れ-、-ば.れ、は.らす	晴らす (は.らす), 晴れる (は.れる)

When someone you know who is normally talkative goes quiet, it´s usually a sign that they are contending with the blues.	Don't confuse with silence (#240), something achieved through action. On the other hand, quiet refers to a personal quality of not speaking out. Members of Blue-man group jump into the wrestling ring of contenders for tag-team wrestling. Though the other contenders are screaming, the blue men never say anything - they are a very quiet bunch, that Blue-man group. Primitive order: blue man group's first and main characteristic is being blue and quiet; only later did they decide to become wrestling contenders.	4	3	セイ、ジョウ	しず-、しず.か、しず.まる、しず.める	静止 (せいし), 静穏 (せいおん), 安静 (あんせい), 静 (しず), 静か (しず.か), 静まる (しず.まる), 静める (しず.める)
1661	blame	Trách	責	blame, grow up, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	11	40	Grow up . . . oyster.		As one grows up, one typically starts to blame all of their problems on money.	This is the story of a poor fisherman and his wife. A long time ago he caught an oyster with a small but precious pearl. The intelligent wife told him to sell the pearl immediately: the greedy husband figured if he kept the oyster and fed it, it would grow up and yield an even bigger pearl. One day the oyster grew so big, it crashed through the house and escaped back to sea. The angry wife left her husband, blaming his blind greed for their poverty.	5	3	セキ	せ.める	責める (せ.める)

1663	volume	Tích (tích phân, tích tụ)	積	volume, wheat, cereal, blame, grow up, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	16	40	Wheat . . . blame. This key word has to do with measurement, and should be kept distinct from the kanji for quantity (Frame 189) - even though the meanings are similar.		"On many wheat cereal boxes, there is a disclaimer stating that ""This package is sold by weight, not by volume. Some settling of contents may have occurred."" well they only say that because they don´t want to be blamed by people getting really disappointed after they see what a small volume of cereal the box really contains."	The volume of the wheat crop is way down this year! Blame the weather!	4	3	セキ	つ.む、-づ.み、つ.もる、つ.もり	積む (つ.む), 積もる (つ.もる)

This character represents the ""outside"" of a garment, just as the kanji for back (Frame 426) depicted the ""inside"" or lining."

1667	bag	Biếu	俵	bag, person, surface, grow up, scarf	10	40	Keep this kanji distinct from that for sack (Frame 1081). Its elements are: person . . . surface.		Superficial people (ie those who are only concerned about the surface) are obsessed with expensive bags.	Do you know why every person in Japan has a Louis Vuitton bag? After the 1985 JAL air crash that killed 520 people (the world´s worst). An image on tv of the crash showed Louis Vuitton bags (whose LV logo covered surface was somehow impervious) litering the crash site.

1669	pledge	Khế	契	pledge, flick knife, grow up, dagger, large, St. Bernard	9	40	Grow up . . . dagger . . . St. Bernard dog. The connotation of this character should be kept distinct from that for vow (Frame 1214) and promise (Frame 1462).		Imagine a totalitarian regime where, while growing up, you have to pledge allegiance to the flag at dagger-point and with St. Bernard guard dogs watching you.	In order to pledge into her sorority, Alice had to stab a St. Bernard with a dagger. (Come on! DO it, Alice!).	JH	1	ケイ	ちぎ.る	契る (ちぎ.る)

With kids growing up in your house, you have to keep them from harm of putting anything in their mouth, paint chips, bleach, knvies, etc.	This is silly, but..

1672	control	Hạt	轄	control, car, harm, mansion, house, grow up, mouth	17	40	"Car . . . harm. Hint: the image of an auto going ""out of control"" may help keep this key word distinct from others like it, such as manipulate (Frame 864)."		Control is very important! Especially when operating a car. Few people realize the harm they can cause just by losing control of their car for a second. Tremendous harm. Stay in control!	The roads are icy, and a whole bunch of cars have spun out of control! Luckily, it was just a couple of dents; nobody was harmed.	JH	1	カツ	くさび

Under the watchful (sideways) eye of my mother, we had to study it until we knew it by heart.	The constitution states the following rights: You may live in your own house and grow up. And you will never be watched by big brother's eye so they cannot control your heart (your believes).	6	1	ケン		
1675	life	Sinh	生	life, This is Your Life, cell, drop, grow up	5	40	A single drop added to the element for grow up gives us the character for life.	* As a primitive, we may think of a microscopic cell, that miraculous unit that grows up to become a living being.	This is the first CELL of a human, the foundation of its entire LIFE, a small DROP that will GROW UP to form a complex organism.	Growing Up is just a Drop of our LIFE.	1	5	セイ、ショウ	い.きる、い.かす、い.ける、う.まれる、う.まれ、うまれ、う.む、お.う、は.える、は.やす、き、なま、なま-、な.る、な.す、む.す、-う	生活 (せいかつ), 発生 (はっせい), 先生 (せんせい), 生かす (い.かす), 生きる (い.きる), 生ける (い.ける), 生まれる (う.まれる), 生む (う.む), 生う (お.う), 生 (き), 生 (なま), 生える (は.える), 生やす (は.やす)

1680	animal sacrifice	Sinh	牲	animal sacrifice, cow, life, This is Your Life, cell, drop, grow up	9	40	Cow . . . cell.		Animal sacrifice = taking the life of a cow.	In the 21st century, animal sacrifice is no longer really necessary. We can take a single cell from a cow, with no harm to the cow. We create a viable cell line from this single cell, and feed the resulting biomatter into a furnace at the exact rate necessary to appease the gods.	JH	1	セイ

The elements we have to work with are: pinnacle . . . walking legs . . . cell."		You are struggling to the top across the humps, but you suddenly see the pinnacle and you feel new life in your walking legs.	A woman takes her bra off and what happens? Nine months later the hump in her belly pops out between her legs as a new life.	JH	1	リュウ		
1683	summit	Phong	峰	summit, mountain, Segway, Macbeth, walking legs, bushes	10	40	Mountain . . . walking legs . . . bushes.		"Walking legs over ""bushes"" needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 sew (#1563), 逢 tryst (#2417), 蜂 bee (#2687), and 鋒 sword´s point (#2768), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. ""Pointy"" works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a summit is the pointy end of a mountain."	Upon reaching the summit of the mountain, I noticed my walking legs were all gouged up from walking through prickly bushes.	JH	1	ホウ	みね、ね	峰 (みね)

1687	longevity	Thọ	寿	longevity, bushes, glue	7	40	Bushes . . . glue.		This old China man glued shrubs to his body. The added intake of oxygen from the shrubs was, according to him, the secret of his longevity. Sometimes he would sit all day in meditation without moving, and the locals believed the old man had actually turned into a shrub !	In an attempt to increase a bush's longevity, an incompitent gardener glues all the leaves back on that have fallen off. Maybe he should have tried watering it instead.

1688	casting	Chú	鋳	casting, metal, gold, longevity, bushes, glue	15	40	Metal . . . longevity. As you probably guessed from the elements, the key word refers to the casting of metals.		They made a metal casting of the Chinese man who glued shrubs to himself to increase his longevity. It's now sold around the world as it's thought that having one will increase your own longevity.	We take a casting because metal will have much greater longevity than the original.	JH	1	チュウ、イ、シュ、シュウ	い.る	鋳る (い.る)

Once upon a time, in order to enroll in a Christian school you had to answer a series of questions to ensure that you were really Christian. For example, the principal might show you a picture of a Christmas tree and a picture of some bamboo and ask you which one is most suitable for decoration at Christmas time.	Japanese father enrolls his student in a well-rounded school: they teach eastern traditions (the way of the bamboo), western traditions (like Christmas trees), and also teach literature (once upon a time).

In heaven you are surrounded by bonsai trees (full-sized ones fall through the clouds) while you play music on your harp.

1694	reality	Thực	実	reality, house, bonsai	8	40	House . . . bonsai.		Bonsais are grown in a house, away from the harsh reality of the real world where they wouldn´t survive.	On this rather boring ´big brother´ type reality show, they have locked up bonsai inside a house and everyone is watching them on TV 24x7.

He had a little room with prayer beads, incense, etc. One day he brought an offerand that he thought would please the god of corn : a bonsai - corn (a corn plant turned into a bonsai).

1698	discreet	Cẩn	謹	discreet, say, words, keitai, mouth, cabbage, flowers, mouth, grow up	17	40	Words . . . cabbage.		Cabbage primitive: When a cabbage is growing up, you must put it in your mouth before it flowers, because that´s when it becomes bitter. Seriously, it´s called ´bolting´ or something. When you´re discreet, you try to make your words like a cabbage: well-layered, but in an unassuming way.	Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I discreetly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.	JH	1	キン	つつし.む	謹む (つつし.む)

1709	ride	Thừa (lên xe)	乗	ride, wheat, cereal, silage	9	40	The simplest way to remember this character is to find the sprig of wheat in it, hidden because it doubles up with one stroke of silage.

[ride; power; multiplication; record; counter for vehicles; board; mount; join] In the near future, we hope to ride on biomass fueled vehicles.

1711	now	Kim (đương kim bạch nhật)	今	now, meeting, umbrella, one, 7	4	41	The final stroke of this kanji is a rare shape, which we have not met before and will only meet in this character and others that include it as a primitive. We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes - for instance, as the second stroke of mouth. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is now. The element above it, meeting, should easily relate to that image.	* We shall use clock as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation.	My MEETING is at 7- but that´s NOW!	(re: ruuku35) The meeting is not at quarter to seven but now!	2	5	コン、キン	いま	今後 (こんご), 今日 (きょう), 今朝 (けさ), 今年 (こんねん), 昨今 (さっこん), 今 (いま)
1712	include	Hàm (hàm ý, hàm súc)	含	include, now, clock, mouth	7	41	Clock . . . mouth.		This clock includes a mouth that will tell you what the time is now. Hearing impaired people have this kind of watches... now imagine them as a big mouth under the clock.	Batteries included with this clock. Open the mouth at the back and insert them after purchase.

1714	versify	Ngâm	吟	versify, mouth, now, clock	7	41	As we have already learned characters for poem (Frame 370), chant (Frame 21), and song (Frame 508), it is important to protect this key word with an image all its own. Its elements are the same as those above; only the position has changed: mouth . . . clock.		A rapper is trying to versify, but sucks: Hickery dickery dock, the mouth spat out the clock. I'm gonna shoot you with my glock, if you don't suck my cock! Versify!	To versify, words of rhythm needs to shoot out of your MOUTH with a CLOCK-like regularity.	JH	1	ギン		
1715	wish	Niệm (tưởng niệm)	念	wish, now, clock, heart	8	41	Clock . . . heart.		Someone wishing from the bottom of their heart that the clock would stop. A mid-life crisis perhaps.

1717	harp	Cầm	琴	harp, king, jewel, ball, now, clock, king2, jewel2, ball2	12	41	A pair of jewels . . . clock.		Two kings were fighting over a beautiful koto (harp). So they had a clock built into it that would measure how long each one played it. That way they could be sure none played it more than othe other.	"Jesus is coming soon. Prepare to meet the king of kings now. Practice your harp playing skills all future angels!...　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　キン　琴線　きんせん(""heart strings"")."	JH	1	キン	こと	琴 (こと)
1718	shade	Âm	陰	shade, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, now, clock, rising cloud, two, elbow, wall	11	41	Just as the sunshine (Frame 1397) represents the masculine principle in nature (Yang), the shade stands for the feminine principle (Yin). Its elements are: pinnacle . . . clock . . . rising cloud.		There are three types of shade: 1. natural (a high pinnacle), 2. man-made buildings (a clock tower), 3. meteorological (a cloud).	Frosty the snowman is running around the pinnacle, staying in the shade. As he looks at his clock to see how much longer he can last, small clouds rise (steam) from his body. Nooo, Frosty!	JH	1	イン	かげ、かげ.る	陰 (かげ), 陰る (かげ.る)
1719	beforehand	Dự	予	beforehand, halberd with stroke missing	4	41	Think of this character as identical to the halberd (Frame 1311) except that the final stroke has been omitted. Return to that character and devise some image to take this difference into account.		Beforehand, this was a halberd but I cut it short so it could be for hand to hand combat.	Your halberd doesn´t have a handguard? You should have thought of that beforehand (i.e., before you were missing your hand).	3	3	ヨ、シャ	あらかじ.め	
1720	preface	Tự	序	preface, cave, beforehand	7	41	Cave . . . beforehand.		The preface to all human history was written beforehand in caves.	"Rename the ""beforehand"" part to be glove (because you have to wear gloves beforehand if you want to wield the halberd, which is why this primitive is an incomplete halberd). The story: a winter morning. A textbook author is holed up in his tiny office, a veritable cave. He wants to start his masterpiece textbook by first writing the preface. But he can´t get started. He sits and stares at empty paper until evening. It gets cold and he puts on gloves, shivering, but still unable to start his preface."	5	1	ジョ	つい.で、ついで	
1721	deposit	Dự	預	deposit, beforehand, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	13	41	Beforehand . . . head.

1722	plains	Dã (cánh đồng)	野	plains, computer, beforehand	11	41	This character refers to rustic life and rustic fields primarily, and from there gets derived meanings. Its elements: computer. . beforehand.		These days we all work in front of computers. Beforehand we all worked out in the fields, in the plains.	The plains are a challenging place to get any work done. Be sure you recharge your computer´s battery beforehand, or you won´t get anything done.	2	4	ヤ、ショ	の、の-	野 (の)
1723	concurrently	Kiêm (kiêm nhiệm)	兼	concurrently, animal horns, rake, stick, stick2	10	41	At the top we have the animal horns and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one rake with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs concurrently, using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances.		Our ninja hero, disguised as a gardener with a rake, is suddenly attacked from both left and right concurrently by bulls with animal horns. Our hero lets out a blood-curdling scream and tears his rake handle vertically in half, so he now has two wooden staffs (split rake handle) to fight with. He grips each staff (left side and right side) and rams it into the horns of the charging bulls. The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again (split bottom of each rake handle).	You decide to take the bull by the horns and do both chores concurrently, grabbing your double-handled rake before attempting to clean up both your´s and your neighbours´ garden. But unfortunately, it´s not long until your rake splits in two.	JH	1	ケン	か.ねる、-か.ねる	兼ねる (か.ねる)
1724	dislike	Hiềm (hiềm khích)	嫌	dislike, woman, concurrently, animal horns, rake	13	41	Woman . . . concurrently.

1725	sickle	Liêm (cái liềm)	鎌	sickle, metal, gold, concurrently, animal horns, rake	18	41	Metal . . . concurrently.		This is a special sickle with metal blades on both sides. It can cut many things concurrently!	The gold sickle of the USSR flag represents both leaders and workers laboring concurrently.	JH	1	レン、ケン	かま	鎌 (かま)
1726	self-effacing	Khiêm	謙	self-effacing, say, words, keitai, mouth, concurrently, animal horns, rake	17	41	Words . . . concurrently.		When you are self-effacing you use words to concurrently bring yourself down and make yourself look better.	Though the man´s words were self-effacing, his actions concurrently made it clear that his modesty was false.	JH	1	ケン		
1727	bargain	Liêm (thanh liêm)	廉	bargain, cave, concurrently, animal horns, rake	13	41	Cave . . . concurrently.		"Stores don´t want you to know it, but if you find the secret cave, they run bargains there concurrently to their regular prices. (Image: pulling a certain level in a store to find the ""bargain cave)."

1728	west	Tây	西	west, one, four	6	41	To our way of counting directions, the west always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for four in this kanji. But since we want only one of the four directions, the west adds the one at the top and sucks the human legs a bit out of their mouth in the process.	* As a primitive, the meaning of west can be expanded to refer to the Old West of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for east was expanded into the East. Note, however, that in its primitive form the legs are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the mouth. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.	The old west represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare sign of the bird (#1427) whiskey bottle about one third full).	Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.	2	5	セイ、サイ、ス	にし	西暦 (せいれき), 西部 (せいぶ), 北西 (ほくせい), 西 (にし)
1729	value	Giá	価	value, person, old west	8	41	Person . . . Old West.		In the West, people have no value. Only money is important.	"What might it mean for a person in the old west to be of value? Their face is on a ""Wanted!"" poster, of course. Imagine the reward..."	5	1	カ、ケ	あたい	価 (あたい)
1730	need	Yếu (yêu cầu)	要	need, old west, woman	9	41	Old West . . . woman.		In the Old West, women were needed because nobody knew how to cook or clean.	In some movie with the theme of the Old West, the population of a town finds themselve in dire need of women, after all of the town´s womens became crazy and started gunshooting and participating in duels and such.	4	3	ヨウ	い.る	要る (い.る)
1731	loins	Yêu (eo lưng)	腰	loins, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, need, old west, woman	13	41	Part of the body . . . need.		If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰(こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say 腰がいたい！It´s the part of the body that needs massaging.	"To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword ´loins´ because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to-remember story. Just because you´re all sexually repressed doesn´t mean other people won´t benefit from a story such as ""the part of the body people need more than any other are the loins""."	JH	2	ヨウ	こし	腰 (こし)
1732	ballot	Phiếu, tiêu, phiêu (Lá phiếu, sự bỏ phiếu kín)	票	ballot, old west, altar, show, two, small	11	41	Old West . . . altar.		In the Old West there were no ballot boxes. Afraid of fraud and fighting among the gunslingers, the ballots were posted into a slot in the top of the local church altar instead. They may have been rough, but the cowboys wouldn´t fight in the church.	In western political elections (US), peoples ballots will often depend on religion and at which altar the prospective president prays.	4	1	ヒョウ		
1733	drift	Phiêu (phiêu lưu)	漂	drift, water, water droplets, water pistol, ballot, old west, altar, show, two, small	14	41	Water . . . ballot.

He calmly watched them drift away as the cops came to a screech behind him.	JH	1	ヒョウ	ただよ.う	漂う (ただよ.う)

Since the days of the Old West, traveling has transitioned from trying not to step on big snakes to driving on big roads.	The west has gone through quite a transition, gone are the days when dogs and snakes roamed the desert, it´s all roads and casinos now.	JH	1	セン	うつ.る、うつ.す、みやこがえ

Old West has capsized, and all the cowboys on board are trying to restore her upright.	Remember Oregon Trail? Remember how you had to float your wagon across rivers to get to the Old West? Well, sometimes that wagon capsizes. Once that happens you´d better quickly head to the nearest town to restore.	JH	1	フク	おお.う、くつがえ.す、くつがえ.る	覆う (おお.う), 覆す (くつがえ.す), 覆る (くつがえ.る)

South of my belt leads to happiness.	"In the south (Southern Alabama, Southern Africa, picture any south, but choose one and stick with it) ""they measure happyness by the belt"".

1743	gates	Môn (nhập môn)	門	gates	8	42	The pictograph of two swinging gates is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized. In case you should have any trouble, though, you might doodle with the shapes on a piece of paper, taking care to note the difference in the stroke order of the two facing doors. The gates usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose.	* As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of gates, but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for door.	"Heisig´s stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful -- first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the ""sun"" attachment as you would normally. In fact, if you just wrote it out as two suns with elongated sides, you´ll get the stroke order exactly correct."	The gates to Hell. guarded by Cerebus or ... Bill Gates?	2	2	モン	かど、と	門 (かど)
1744	question	Vấn	問	question, gates, mouth	11	42	Gates . . . mouth.		"A mouth on the Gates of Hell says ""Answer me these questions three, or thru the gates ye soon will be""."	Hark!

1745	review	Duyệt	閲	review, gates, devil, horns, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs	15	42	Gates . . . devil. Keep the connotation of this key word distinct from those of inspection (Frame 1174), revise (Frame 362), and perusal (Frame 919).		A little devil at the gates of hell reviews your record to see if you´re evil enough to get in.	As I was reviewing for my exam at a quiet saloon, the devil popped out of nowhere and offered to make sure I pass. But I told him no way, since that´s cheating. Besides, I´m just reviewing things I already know. I won´t fail. But he kept insisting, so I kicked him and sent him crashing through the entrance gates.	JH	1	エツ	けみ.する	
1746	clique	Phiệt	閥	clique, gates, fell, person, fiesta	14	42	Gates . . . fell.		You set a guard at the gate to fell intruders not of your clique.	The felled souls of the world, cut down like trees, pass through the gates of hell and join the clique.	JH	1	バツ		
1747	interval	Gian	間	interval, gates, sun, day	12	42	Gates . . . sun/day. This interval applies to time and space alike, but the latter is better for creating an image.		The interval between star systems (suns) was too large, so the stargates were created to travel between them.	We open the gates at regular intervals to let a bit of sun in.	2	5	カン、ケン	あいだ、ま、あい	間隔 (かんかく), 中間 (ちゅうかん), 時間 (じかん), 間 (あいだ), 間 (ま)
1749	simplicity	Giản	簡	simplicity, bamboo, interval, gates, sun, day	18	42	Bamboo . . . interval.

(Inspired by PepeSeco).	The simplicity of bamboo plant is in all its joints being at equal intervals.	6	2	カン

Sure you can squeeze through these gates by kicking them or pushing them with your body, but if you want to get them wide open, you need to do that with both your hands.	To open the gate, use your both hands.	3	4	カイ	ひら.く、ひら.き、-びら.き、ひら.ける、あ.く、あ.ける	開く (あ.く), 開ける (あ.ける), 開く (ひら.く), 開ける (ひら.ける)

Alright none of you GENIUSES could figure out how the door is CLOSED, so I invented these. They are called the SALOON DOORS.

1752	towering tower	Các	閣	tower, gates, each, walking legs, mouth	14	42	Gates . . . each.		"To keep this distinct from other kanji such as ""watchtower"" and ""pagoda"", I use the mnemonic ""towering tower"". -- In some old 8-bit kung-fu videogame, with a plot similar as Bruce Lee´s last, unfinished movie, the hero must break through a gate at each level of the towering tower, fighting with opponents using various styles of kung-fu until he meets the finale at the topmost level of the ""towering tower""."	Remember the two towers from lord of the rings... each has it´s own - very difficult to master - entrance gate.	6	1	カク		
1753	leisure	Nhàn	閑	leisure, gates, tree, wood	12	42	Gates . . . tree.		Imagine the gates the Garden of Eden, the ultimate land of leisure. You´re not allowed in, but if you peek through you can see trees.	Imagine Leisure Suit Larry walking through the saloon doors with wood in his pants, hoping to get lucky.	JH	1	カン		
1754	hear	Văn	聞	hear, gates, ear	14	42	Gates . . . ear. Compare the story you invented for the kanji meaning listen (Frame 890).		Press your ear to the gates and see if you can hear what is going on inside.	To distinguish from listen, you hear someone at the door (gate).	2	5	ブン、モン	き.く、き.こえる	新聞 (しんぶん), 風聞 (ふうぶん), 見聞 (けんぶん), 聞く (き.く), 聞こえる (き.こえる)
1755	wet	Nhuận	潤	wet, water, water droplets, water pistol, intercalate, gates, king, jewel, ball	15	42	Water . . . gates . . . king.		Forgetting about the moat, the king stepped out of his gate and landed in the water. Needless to say he got wet.	(I had the same idea as Dingomick) I imagine some prankster who put a bucket full of water on top of the huge gates, so that it would fall on the king as he came through them. See the king now, between the gates, all wet, dripping drops of water.	JH	1	ジュン	うるお.う、うるお.す、うる.む	潤む (うる.む), 潤う (うるお.う), 潤す (うるお.す)

A column of text scratched on a black tree beside the gates of Hell: To the East lies The Beast.

1757	fight	Đấu	闘	fight, gates, beans, table, one, mouth, glue	18	42	Gates . . . table . . . glue. Do not confuse with contend (Frame 1238).		During the saloon brawl, one guy got glued to a table and was tossed out through the saloon gates. But he really wanted to fight, so he ran back through those gates (with the table still glued to his back) only to be tossed out again. Imagine him repeatedly running in and being tossed back out.	Food fight! Look, beans are stuck to the gates like glue.	JH	1	トウ	たたか.う、あらそ.う	闘う (たたか.う)
1758	godown	Thương (nhà kho)	倉	godown, meeting, single gate, umbrella, stable door, mouth	10	42	The single gate is used here not in order to represent one gate, but many of them, indeed a meeting of gates. Add mouth (as an entrance here) and you end up with godown. That should help keep this character distinct from warehouse (Frame 633).		(Warning-this one is crude) Imagine a godown (dockside warehouse) where you can meet girls who will godown on you with their mouth. To keep the place a bit of a secert, they only have one gate.	Note: this is not gate but actually a variation of door and is written as such, with the vertical stroke last not first.	4	1	ソウ	くら	倉 (くら)

1760	un-	Phi	非	un-, jail cell, prison bars	8	42	"This key word, a negating prefix, is a doodle of a heavy iron pole with bars extending in both directions, to create the picture of a jail cell. From there to ""un-"" is but a short step."	* As a primitive, we shall draw on the explanation above for the meaning of jail cell.	This looks like a pictogram of 3 fingers from each hand trying to open up a crack in a wall. That´s an un-believable way to escape from prison OR the UN- have a prison in the Hague.	People in the jail cell are un-friendly, un-comely, and un-cooperative.	5	3	ヒ	あら.ず	
1761	haiku	Bài	俳	haiku, person, un-, jail cell, prison bars	10	42	This character is used for the haiku, the 17-syllable poem that is one of Japan's best-known literary forms.

1763	sad	Bi	悲	sad, un-, jail cell, prison bars, heart	12	42	Jail cell . . . heart.		Saddness is like having your heart captured and jailed because of some sad or terrible event, etc. Here the sad heart waits for someone to come and un-lock their jail cell and set them free again.	Stuck in a jail cell with his heart crying out to see his family again, the prisoner has never felt so sad.	3	3	ヒ	かな.しい、かな.しむ	悲しい (かな.しい), 悲しむ (かな.しむ)

[note: ´UNDER the eye of the law´ works in penalty (#833) as well.].	It is his guilt that is causing them. He is having these nightmares where the great (sideways) eye appears at the top of his jail cell, and is staring down intently at him. Guilt is a merciless tormentor.	5	3	ザイ	つみ	罪 (つみ)

Every time the prison officers come to take him they ask him to come to the door. The old man with a grin always answers ""Which door?"", looking at his painted door with a grin. And the prison officer always answer, sighing - ""The front door !""."	JH	1	ヒ	とびら	扉 (とびら)
1767	marquis	Hầu	侯	marquis, person, key, dart, drop, heavens	9	42	Person . . . key . . . dart. Hint: the pun suggested by the pronunciation of the key word and the primitive for key may come in helpful.		Mr. T is made a marquis after he and the A-Team save the life of a duke. The duke also gives Mr. T the key to the gentleman's dart room where one can relax in luxury, smoke a cigar, and play a friendly game of darts. Mr. T eagerly accepts the key and places it on one of the gold chains that hang around his neck which acts as a key chain.	(Going off various) Mr. T. is made a marquis and given the key to the city. But somebody disagrees with it and assassinates him with a dart.	JH	1	コウ		
1769	climate	Hậu	候	climate, marquis, person, stick, fred astaire, key, dart, drop, heavens	10	42	Marquis . . . walking stick. Note where the walking stick is positioned in this kanji.		The marquis has absolutely no interest in issuses of climate change. He´s old and near death. [Don´t forget the walking stick to symbolize his old age.].	The marquis moves to a warmer climate after he gets old enough to need a walking stick to get around.	4	3	コウ	そうろう	候 (そうろう)
1770	decide	Quyết	決	decide, water, water droplets, water pistol, guillotine, key, St. Bernard	7	42	The etymology of decide (de-cidere = cut off) will help here; the elements are: water . . . guillotine.		"Decide! ""Decide?! Death by drowning in polluted water or death by guillotine. How can I decide?"" I asked."	To decide if someone is a witch or not first dunk them in water. If they don´t drown they are a witch and can be sent to the guillotine.	3	3	ケツ	き.める、-ぎ.め、き.まる、さ.く	決まる (き.まる), 決める (き.める)
1771	cheerful	Khoái	快	cheerful, Freud, state of mind, guillotine, key, St. Bernard	7	42	State of mind . . . guillotine.		A large crowd in a cheerful state of mind applaude each criminal as they become victims of the guillotine.	A cheerful crowd of insulted aliens applaude as Data´s head is chopped off by guillotine.	5	2	カイ	こころよ.い	快い (こころよ.い)
1772	admirable	Vĩ	偉	admirable, person, locket, stick, key, mouth, monocle, sunglasses with one lens missing	12	42	Person . . . locket.		LOCKETs often carry inside them a picture of a PERSON we find ADMIRABLE.	"For locket: The locket (key dangling from something, the vertical stroke) opens like a mouth, but you need a jeweler´s monocle to make out the pictures within. ----- Dracula survives a staking attempt when the locket with Mina´s admirable picture deflects the blow. ""It was an admirable attempt,"" he admits as he sucks his attacker´s blood."	JH	3	イ	えら.い	偉い (えら.い)
1773	difference	Vi (trái, vi phạm)	違	difference, locket, stick, key, mouth, monocle, sunglasses with one lens missing, road	13	42	Locket . . . road.		"You lose your precious locket on the road to somewhere. You ask people if they´ve seen it, but no luck. ""Just buy another one,"" someone says. ""I mean, what´s the difference?"" Then of course you say ""Well, it makes a huge difference!! Since it has sentimental value, I don´t want a different one! "" Then of course they understand."	"An odd version of The Road Less Traveled: ""I found a locket in the road, and that has made all the difference.""."	JH	3	イ	ちが.う、ちが.い、ちが.える、-ちが.える、たが.う、たが.える	違う (ちが.う), 違える (ちが.える)
1774	horizontal	Vĩ	緯	horizontal, thread, spiderman, locket, stick, key, mouth, monocle, sunglasses with one lens missing	16	42	Thread . . . locket.		Spiderman buys a locket for Mary Jane because he wants to get HORIZONTAL with her.	"Hint : this kanji also means ""latitude"", which are the horizontal lines on a globe. Do you remember James Heisig's story for frame 175 ""black ink"" ? Here a cartographer on a ship, is using his ""thread locket"" to mark horizontal lines on a map. He pulls a chalked thread from the locket, and snaps it to mark horizontal lines. Imagine the ""thread-locket"" in the shape of a globe, filled with dark powder and a little bobbin of thread."	JH	1	イ	よこいと、ぬき	
1775	defense	Vệ	衛	defence, boulevard, going, locket, stick, key, mouth, monocle, sunglasses with one lens missing	16	42	Boulevard . . . locket. Do not confuse with ward off (Frame 1399), protect (Frame 1072), guard (Frame 198), or safeguard (Frame 756).		"[defense; protection] For ""defense against the dark arts"" class, you go the magical boulevard and buy an enchanted locket."	Since it was in the middle of the boulevard, everyone could see she hit the man only in self-defense, as he was trying to steal her valuable locket.	5	1	エイ、エ		
1776	Korea	Hàn	韓	korea, mist, ten, needle, early, sun, day, locket, stick, key, mouth, monocle, sunglasses with one lens missing, ten2, needle2	18	42	As with Italy (Frame 1245) and Africa (Frame 1391), this character simply abbreviates the full name of Korea. Its elements: mist . . . locket.		This character represents the flag of South Korea: a locket (circular taegeuk) in the middle of the mist (white background). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_South_Korea.	"There´s a young Korean male actor, Yon-sama, famous amongst middle-aged Japanese women. Extremely famous. Read about his affect on Japan/Korean relations on Everything2.com. In any case, women just flipped over this guy, traveled to Korea to see his home, started taking Korean language classes, etc. So, imagine here the misty eyes of the Japanese women as they clutch their lockets with Yon-sama´s picture inside watching his Korean romantic mini series called ""Winter Sonata""."	JH		カン	から、いげた	
1777	dry	Can	干	dry, clothesline	3	43	It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind's eye to give it the connotation of to dry.	* The primitive meaning is clothesline.	Dry one item in ten minutes on the clothesline.	Note: the book shows the strokes for potato rather than dry...dry does not have the hook at the end.	6	2	カン	ほ.す、ほ.し-、-ぼ.し、ひ.る	干る (ひ.る), 干す (ほ.す)
1778	liver	Can (gan, tâm can)	肝	liver, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, dry, clothesline	7	43	Part of the body . . . dry.		Well you all know that the liver is the part of the body that would be quite grateful if you led a dry lifestyle (i.e. no alcohol).	The slaughterhouse prefers to ship dried liver to the supermarkets (can you imagine boxes soaked in blood on the truck that delivers them?). Imagine them lifting the slabs of flesh and hanging them on the clothesline to dry.	JH	1	カン	きも	肝 (きも)
1779	publish	San	刊	publish, dry, clothesline, sword, sabre, saber	5	43	Dry . . . saber.		The newspaper pages are hung on the clotheseline to dry and then cut down with a sabre to be published.	The newspaper pages are hung on the clotheseline to dry. This gives the government a chance to censor the news: they cut up unwanted stories with a sabre. Therefore, only state-approved stories are published.	5	2	カン		
1780	sweat	Hãn	汗	sweat, water, water droplets, water pistol, dry, clothesline	6	43	Water . . . dry.		The way sweat is supposed to work: it gets your skin wet, and then as it evaporates/dries, it cools you off.	When you sweat your clothes become soaked with water, prompting you to hang them to dry on a clothesline.	JH	2	カン	あせ	汗 (あせ)
1781	flats	Hiên (đếm nhà)	軒	flats, car, dry, clothesline	10	43	This kanji, a counter for houses, is made up of cars . . . dry.		Flats in the city are crowded. You get a space for your car in front, and a clothesline out back. Nothing else.	Small flats (garages) for cars help keeping them dry.	JH	2	ケン	のき	軒 (のき)
1782	beach	Ngạn (bờ)	岸	beach, mountain, cliff, dry, clothesline	8	43	Mountain . . . cliff . . . dry.		At the base of mountain cliffs, there is usually a beach. You often can see people lying there, drying off after a swim.	Three impossibilities for a beach: There cannot be a beach at the top of a mountain. There cannot be a beach on the top of a cliff. There cannot be a beach that is completely dry.	3	2	ガン	きし	岸 (きし)
1783	tree trunk	Cán	幹	tree trunk, mist, ten, needle, early, sun, day, umbrella, dry, clothesline, ten2, needle2	13	43	Mist . . . umbrella . . . dry. The meaning of this key word extends beyond tree trunks to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for book (Frame 224) and body (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a tree trunk, as well as the kanji for trunk (Frame 194).		A fine mist is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the tree-trunk, effectively using the rest of the tree as an umbrella in order to keep dry.	By astridtops - In the rainy mist, Totoro is standing in front of a tree-trunk at the bus stop, under the umbrella he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains dry! Great story...which I get to by thinking: tree-trunk->TT ->Tonari no Totoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.	5	1	カン	みき	幹 (みき)
1784	potato	Dụ	芋	potato, flowers, potato	6	43	Flowers . . . potato.		If your potatos are growing flowers and those little hooked roots, you should either buy less or eat them faster.	If your potatoes are growing flowers, you need to store them in a more dry place, like hanging them on hooks so they don´t accumulate moisture on the floor.	JH	1	ウ	いも	芋 (いも)
1785	eaves	Vũ (vũ trụ, dưới mái)	宇	eaves, house, potato	6	43	House . . . potato.		Under the eaves of the house the poor family has potate plants.	Very good image Erik. To help those who struggleded with this, the eaves of a house is usually the bit where you hang the roof gutter along, usually made of zinc or plastic and shaped as a half-pipe. It catches rain water, so it flows to a drain pipe instead of down onto people and windows. And in this family the potato plants grow along the eaves so the water pours down on them. They are poor. so no gutter.	6	2	ウ		
1786	too much	Dư	余	too much, umbrella, potato, small	7	43	Umbrella . . . potato . . . little. The last stroke of potato and the first of little coincide in this character.	"* Since the phrase ""too much"" is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a scale whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because too much weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself."	You hang an umbrella upside-down on a hook of the scales and fill it with little potatoes. No luck: it weights too much.	"This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means too little in negative sentences and too much in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol "">"" (more than, another meaning!!) as the umbrella component, and using two (#2) and little (#105) for the potato primitive. So, this kanji either means ""two much"" (more than 2) or ""two little"". (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!)."	5	3	ヨ	あま.る、あま.り、あま.す、あんま.り	余す (あま.す), 余る (あま.る)
1787	exclude	Trừ	除	exclude, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small	10	43	Pinnacle . . . scale.		You won´t make it unless you exclude something. The climb to the pinacle cannot be completed if you are carrying too much. You just have to decide what you can afford to exclude.	To become a member of The Pinnacle, they test you on a scale. If you weigh too much, they exclude you.	6	3	ジョ、ジ	のぞ.く、-よ.け	除外 (じょがい), 除数 (じょすう), 解除 (かいじょ), 除く (のぞ.く)
1788	gradually	Từ (từ từ)	徐	gradually, Nelson, column, going, line, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small	10	43	Line . . . scale.		You can´t expect weight loss to happen overnight. You should limit going to the scale to weigh yourself to once a day or once a week, in order to observe the anticipated weight loss gradually.	I set up a column chart next to my scales so I could record my weight gradually changing.	JH	1	ジョ	おもむ.ろに	
1789	confer	Tự (kể lại)	叙	confer, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, crotch	9	43	Scale . . crotch. The key word has to do with conferring ranks, titles, and awards. It should not be confused with bestow (Frame 1335) or impart (Frame 795).		Amazed at the weight of his crotch, they conferred every honor upon him. (Image: guy with his junk on a scale getting a medal pinned to his chest/around his neck/being knighted, etc.).	If there is such a thing as too much crotch, the guy who gets that much should have an honor conferred upon him.	JH	1	ジョ	つい.ず、ついで	
1790	route	Đồ (tiền đồ, đường lối)	途	route, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, road	10	43	Scale . . . road.		On this route, all trucks have to check in at the scales before they can get on the road.	There are too many roads, so you need to plan a route.	JH	3	ト	みち	
1791	diagonal	Tà (nghiêng)	斜	diagonal, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, mmeasuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle	11	43	Scale . . . measuring cup.		The main bar of an old-fashioned scale(balance) will be very diagonal if you place a giant measuring cup on one side.	"The constellation of libra (meaning "" scales"" in latin) is diagonal to the handle of the big dipper."	JH	1	シャ	なな.め、はす	斜め (なな.め)
1792	paint	Đồ	塗	paint, water, water droplets, water pistol, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, soil, dirt, ground	13	43	Water . . . scale . . . ground.		If you add too much water to the paint it will drip onto the ground.	A true artisan mixes his own paint from water and soils on a scale in careful proportions.	JH	2	ト	ぬ.る、ぬ.り、まみ.れる	塗る (ぬ.る)
1793	bundle	Thúc	束	bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth	7	43	In the same way that we were able to see the sun in the tree within the kanji for east, here we see a square container in the shape of a mouth.		Unlike in 杏, this big mouth isn´t content to wait for apricots to fall in his mouth, so he has climbed the tree and is taking them in bundles.	Mnemonic: Bundle of joy. Here I see the proverbial stork with a baby hanging from its mouth fly straight into a tree. Painful, but he doesn´t drop the bundle.	4	3	ソク	たば、たば.ねる、つか、つか.ねる	束 (たば)
1794	trust	Lại (ỷ lại, yêu cầu)	頼	trust, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	16	43	Bundle . . . head.		We found a bundle of severed heads in your room, its difficult to trust you.	When you trust in something, you've got your head 頁 all bundled 束 up (wrapped up) in it.	JH	3	ライ	たの.む、たの.もしい、たよ.る	頼む (たの.む), 頼もしい (たの.もしい), 頼る (たよ.る)
1795	rapids	Lại (thác nước)	瀬	rapids, water, water droplets, water pistol, trust, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	19	43	Water . . . bundle . . . head.		You need complete trust in your water guide to attempt Class 5 rapids.	You can never trust the water in the rapids, it will do everything it can to pull you under. Imagine a line of natives with bundles upon their heads all fighting the rapids to cross the river.	JH	1	ライ	せ	瀬 (せ)
1796	imperial order	Sắc	勅	imperial order, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, power, muscle, arnold	9	43	In order to keep this character distinct from that for an imperial edict (Frame 366), we must draw again on a pun. Think of the order here as a mail order or an order of pizza phoned in by the Emperor for delivery to the imperial palace. Then it will not be hard to put together bundle and muscle to form a story about an imperial order.		This is an imperial order for pizza. To deliver the huge bundle of pizzas to the emperor, the pizza boy needs huge muscles.	Imperial order carries quite a bundle of executive power.	JH	1	チョク	いまし.める、みことのり	
1797	alienate	Sơ (không thân)	疎	alienate, zoo, critters, stop, footprint, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth	12	43	Zoo . . . bundle. Note that the element for zoo is flattened out on the left just as leg (Frame 1372) had been. This is the only time we will meet this form in this book.		[True story] In Osaka the homeless (the alienated) live in large numbers around the city zoo. Picture them in winter all bundled up in rags trying to keep warm, alienated from the society, living literally worst than the animals in the zoo who at least are bundled in their natural furs and have pens to live in sheltered from the elements.	This kanji is so strange that it was alienated at the kanji zoo. The bundle of joy stork bundles this kanji up and takes it to a kanji foster home.	JH	1	ソ、ショ	うと.い、うと.む、まば.ら	疎い (うと.い), 疎む (うと.む)
1799	quick	Tốc	速	quick, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, road	10	43	Bundle . . . road.		If you find a bundle of money on the road, pick it up quick before anyone notices.	Uh oh. The stork just dropped the bundle of joy in the middle of the road. Somebody save it, quick!	3	3	ソク	はや.い、はや-、はや.める、すみ.やか	速やか (すみ.やか), 速い (はや.い), 速める (はや.める)
1800	organize	Chỉnh	整	organise, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, taskmaster, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint	16	43	Bundle . . . taskmaster . . . correct.		Recycling in Japan, you have to make sure all your bundles are organized correctly otherwise the taskmasters won´t accept them.	When a bundle of taskmasters organize something chances are it won´t be done correctly because they are constantly arguing.	3	1	セイ	ととの.える、ととの.う	整う (ととの.う), 整える (ととの.える)
1801	saber	Kiếm	剣	sabre, saber, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person, sword, sabre, saber	10	43	Awl . . . saber. As we promised way back in frame 87, here at last is the kanji on which the primitive element of the same name is based.		If it helps, make the awl primitive ice pick instead. They´re basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the icepick vs. the saber...	"Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of ""The Awl and the Sabre"". According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an awl against a sabre! She used to work all day with that awl. However, the bandit using the sabre had no skill. And thus the awl beat the sabre. And from there the saying goes : ""The sabre is powerless against the awl, if one can´t use the sabre.""."	JH	1	ケン	つるぎ	剣 (つるぎ)
1802	precipitous	Hiếm (hiểm)	険	precipitous, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person	11	43	Pinnacle . . . awl.		The rock climber trying to get up to the pinnacle is dangling from a precipitous edge, hanging only one with his icepick.	Well I have someone climbing an inflatable precipitous pinnacle. Once at the top it is so precipitous that the person is afraid to climb down and instead punctures the inflatable pinnacle with an awl to get safely and slowly back to the ground.	5	3	ケン	けわ.しい	険しい (けわ.しい)
1803	examination	Kiểm	検	examination, tree, wood, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person	12	43	Tree . . . awl.		You're giving a TREE an EXAMINATION. You take a wood sample from the TREE with an AWL (cmp 校 (#1371)).	Don´t confuse with exam (#1278), test (#354), evaluate (#1487). Think of examination as a doctor´s examination. You´re having problems getting wood in bed. You go in for a doctor´s examination. The doctor shoves an icepick into your manhood as part of the examination.	5	1	ケン	しら.べる	
1804	frugal	Kiệm	倹	frugal, person, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person, person2	10	43	Person . . . awl.		Mr. T is as frugal as they come. He uses his one ice pick for everything: to eat, pick his teeth, clean his toilet, kill people, cook, etc.	Khatzumoto needs to be frugal after spending all his money on Japanese media and none on food. His waist has shrunk and he needs a new belt, but being frugal he just punches another hole with his awl.	JH	1	ケン	つま.しい、つづまやか	
1805	heavy	Trọng, trùng	重	heavy, thousand, computer, rice field, brains, soil, dirt, ground	9	43	Thousand . . . ri. Note how the long vertical stroke doubles up to serve both elements.		The first computer in the world was as heavy as thousand computers are now.	"To me it looks like a car with two extra wheels, like a truck. As it is a very heavy vehicle I suggest an image of a huge mining truck, like the yellow Liebherr T282B. Remember that the first ""wheel"" is a bit bent. http://www.primidi.com/2004/06/21.html."	3	4	ジュウ、チョウ	え、おも.い、おも.り、おも.なう、かさ.ねる、かさ.なる、おも	重量 (じゅうりょう), 重大 (じゅうだい), 二重 (にじゅう), 重 (え), 重い (おも.い), 重なる (かさ.なる), 重ねる (かさ.ねる)
1806	move	Động	動	move, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, power, muscle, arnold	11	43	Heavy . . . muscle.		Even though the furniture is heavy, it´ll be easy to move with all the muscles that he has.	His MUSCLES are so HEAVY, he barely can move...thats ironic.	3	4	ドウ	うご.く、うご.かす	動かす (うご.かす), 動く (うご.く)
1808	meritorious deed	Huân	勲	meritorious deed, move, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, power, muscle, arnold, oven-fire, barbecue	15	43	Move . . . oven fire. So as not to confuse this kanji with the general character for merit (Frame 1369), you may associate the key word with military decorations and medals of distinction, both of which it is used for.		A meritorious deed? Like moving a damsel in distress out of a fire, maybe.	Prometheus did a meritous deed for humanity by MOVING FIRE from the gods to us humans.	JH	1	クン	いさお	
1809	work	Động	働	work, person, move, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, power, muscle, arnold	13	43	Person . . . move. Do not confuse with labor (Frame 924).		A person who moves something is doing work, physically speaking.	"Mr T, move. Mr Ts new exercise video called ""Work it suckaz"". Here is shouting ""move it work it move work it!""."	4	3	ドウ、リュク、リキ、ロク、リョク	はたら.く	働く (はたら.く)
1810	species	Chủng	種	species, wheat, cereal, heavy, thousand, ri, computer	14	43	Wheat . . . heavy.		Our species has a wheat heavy diet...	"This kanji also means ""Seed."" STORY: Scientists have developed a new SPECIES of WHEAT that has large HEAVY seeds. Now we can feed the world."	4	3	シュ	たね、-ぐさ	種 (たね)
1811	collide	Xung	衝	collide, boulevard, going, heavy, thousand, ri, computer	15	43	Boulevard . . . heavy.		Two heavy trucks in a game of chicken collide while racing toward each other on the boulevard.	衝 【しょう】 (n) (1) important point (e.g. on a route); (2) important role (responsibility, etc.); (3) (astronomical) opposition. STORY:Two HEAVY trucks are playing a game of chicken on the BOULEVARD. However, they both missed the IMPORTANT POINT: that they have to turn in different directions. Naturally, they COLLIDE when they both turn in the same direction. (ty dingomick).	JH	1	ショウ	つ.く	
1812	fragrant	Huân	薫	fragrant, flowers, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, oven-fire, barbecue	16	43	Flowers . . . heavy . . . oven fire. Do not confuse with incense (Frame 977) or perfumed (Frame 532).		Do you know how they make those FRAGRANT air fresheners? Well you take some FLOWERS, compress them with a HEAVY weight, and put them on an OVEN FIRE for a while... (cmp perfume (#493)).	The heavier the flowers the stronger their fragrance when you burn them.	JH	1	クン	かお.る	薫る (かお.る)
1813	ill	Bệnh	病	ill, sickness, hospital, third class, one, ceiling, inside	10	44	Sickness . . . third class.		Caveman got ill after flying third class. The cabin air and food got to him. (Primitive: these all got MUCH easier when using CAVEMAN instead. ).	If you hang around a third class hospital, you´ll get ill with the sickness everyone else has.	3	4	ビョウ、ヘイ	や.む、-や.み、やまい	病気 (びょうき), 病根 (びょうこん), 看病 (かんびょう), 病む (や.む), 病 (やまい)
1814	stupid	Si	痴	stupid, sickness, hospital, know, dart, drop, heavens, mouth	13	44	Know . . . sickness.		"This kanji shows stupidity as a ""knowledge-sickness"". Everybody can be stupid at times, and it usually happens because of a lack of experience. Hence the stupidity is a ""knowledge sickness""."	Of course caveman is stupid. He doesn´t know anything. He´s a caveman!	JH	1	チ	し.れる、おろか	
1815	pox	Đậu	痘	pox, sickness, hospital, beans, table, one, mouth	12	44	Sickness . . . beans.		Caveman has horrible pox. They look like edamame beans oozing bight green paste.	Pox is a sickness which symptoms include bean-shaped bumps on the skin.	JH	1	トウ		
1816	symptoms	Chứng	症	symptoms, sickness, hospital, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint	10	44	Sickness . . . correct.		Once you have all the symptoms right, you have correctly identified the sickness.	A sickness can only be correctly diagnosed if the symptoms are identified correctly.	JH	1	ショウ		
1819	rapidly	Tật	疾	rapidly, sickness, hospital, dart, drop, heavens	10	44	"Be sure to keep this character distinct from quick (Frame 1799) and swift (Frame 298). Picture a succession of poison darts (the sort that inflict sickness) flying out rapid-fire from a blowgun, so that ""rapid-fire"" can conjure up the proper image."		I picture a sick caveman, and two people rapidly blowing darts at him. One is blowing poison darts, the other is blowing antidote darts. Will the sick caveman live or die? Depends on how rapidly they fire.	If shot with a poison dart, sickness develops rapidly.	JH	1	シツ	はや.い	
1821	diarrhea	Lỵ	痢	diarrhea, sickness, hospital, profit, wheat, cereal, sword, sabre, saber	12	44	Sickness . . . profit.		For a country full of pay-per-use public toilets, sudden diarrhea is certainly the most profitable sickness!	Caveman doesn´t have any skills, so he sells his diarrhea as chili to peasant wheat farmers for an amazing profit.	JH	1	リ		
1823	tired	Bí	疲	exhausted, tired, sickness, hospital, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	10	44	Sickness . . . pelt.		I picture an exhausted sick caveman snuggling up in a comfy pelt blanket.	Your body feels tired when you have a sickness. All you want to do is wrap yourself up in a nice warm pelt and get better.	JH	3	ヒ	つか.れる、-づか.れ、つか.らす	疲らす (つか.らす), 疲れる (つか.れる)
1824	epidemic	Dịch	疫	epidemic, sickness, hospital, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	9	44	Sickness . . . missile.		"Sickness-missiles are being engineered by bio-terrorists to spread epidemics all over the world. Imagine seeing footage of a place where those sickness-missiles are built : rows after rows of missiles, and if you look closely on each is inscribed in tiny letters the name of different sickness such as ""flu"", ""plague"", etc."	SICKNESS / MISSILE ** Hint: True fact about biochemical warfare: in the medieval and ancient world, SICKNESS in the form of the corpses of those who had died from some EPIDEMIC or plague were often hurled at the enemy via the crude MISSILE launchers of the time. [C].	JH	1	エキ、ヤク		疫病 (えきびょう), 悪疫 (あくえき), 防疫 (ぼうえき)
1825	pain	Thống	痛	pain, sickness, hospital, pogo stick, chop-seal, hanko, utilise, utilize	12	44	Sickness . . . chop-seal . . . utilize.		Think of the phrase pain in the xxx. Then think of a pogostick up your xxx. That's painful, right? The real question is why a pogostick is up your xxx. That's sick, dude.	When I was feeling sick my mum said I shouldn´t go out to play on my pogo stick until I felt better. Well I wasn´t strong enough to stay up on it and so fell over and have the pain to prove my mum right.	6	3	ツウ	いた.い、いた.む、いた.ましい、いた.める	痛い (いた.い), 痛む (いた.む), 痛める (いた.める)
1826	mannerism	Phích (tật xấu)	癖	mannerism, sickness, hospital, ketchup, flag, mouth, spicy, stand up, vase, ten, needle	18	44	Sickness . . . ketchup.		Caveman has a bad mannerism of putting ketchup on everything he eats. I guess that´s ok since raw mammoth can´t be too good...	This mannerism is a sickness of the modern generation. It was only recently that we started putting ketchup on everything.	JH	1	ヘキ	くせ、くせ.に	癖 (くせ)
1827	hide	Nặc	匿	hide, box, young, flowers, right, by one’s side, mouth	10	44	Box . . . young.		Young kids likes to hide in cardboard boxes. (Primitive: CARDBOARD BOX, especially kids playing with them.).	Note that stroke order with box primitive is as follows: first horizontal line, then enclosed element, and then a hook (it´s incorrect in 4th edition).	JH	1	トク	かくま.う	
1828	artisan	Tượng	匠	artisan, box, axe	6	44	Box . . . ax.		Hint: Artisan/Ax Def: An artisan is a skilled manual worker; a craftsperson. Here we see his tools represented by the artisan's ax stored in his toolbox.	We here have the axe-man who´s an artisan at making sculptures with his axe... The only thing is, he never shows anyone, keeping all his sculptures inside a box down in the basement. He doesn´t want any attention.	JH	1	ショウ	たくみ	
1829	doctor	Y	医	doctor, box, dart, drop, heavens	7	44	Box . . . dart.		Easily confused: Dr. (#47), doctor (#1694), examination (#1673), check-up (#1724), medicine (#1736). To avoid confusion I renamed this medic, and picture the medic from Team Fortress 2 returning to his box of darts in the supply cupboard every time his syringe gun is empty.	This DOCTOR prefers to use DARTS instead of syringes for injections. Here, he pulls out his BOX of DARTS, and the child on the examination table squirms.	3	4	イ	い.やす、い.する、くすし	
1830	equal	Thất (đôi, đơn, lẻ)	匹	equal, box, human legs	4	44	Box . . . human legs.		Put a box over everyone's heads, letting only the legs show, and we all look pretty much equal.	This kanji is used commonly as a counter for small animals. This is a pictograph of a SMALL ANIMAL´S view from inside a CARDBOARD BOX looking out at his masters HUMAN LEGS. He´s probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones EQUAL fate on the farm: the kitchen table).	JH	2	ヒツ	ひき	匹 (ひき)
1831	ward	Khu	区	ward, box, sheaf	4	44	The ward referred to here is a subdivision of a large city. Its elements: box . . . sheaves. When used as a primitive element, it may be helpful at times to break it up into these same composite elements.		That´s the homeless ward of the city. Wolverine lives in a cardboard box there.	In the homeless ward of the city you see people sleeping in CARDBOARD BOXES using a SHEAF as a pillow.	3	2	ク、オウ、コウ		
1832	hinge	Su	枢	hinge, tree, wood, ward, box, sheaf	8	44	Tree . . . ward.		The hinge on Wolverine's cardboard box is made of wood because he doesn't have enough budget to buy metal hinges.

JH	1	オウ	なぐ.る	殴る (なぐ.る)
1834	Europe	Âu	欧	europe, ward, box, sheaf, lack, yawn	8	44	Ward . . . yawn. Like the kanji of frame 1776, this character is an abbreviation of the name of a geographical region.		Do japanese consider Europe like just a ward, boring enough to make them yawn?? This kanji is offensive!	[Europe] X-Box was first released in America and Japan (the biggest videogame markets). Europe had an X-Box lack for a while...	JH	2	オウ	うた.う、は.く	
1835	repress	Ức	抑	repress, finger, fingers, stamp album, box, stamps	7	44	Fingers . . . box . . . stamps.		A true stamp collecting nerd won't be able to repress the urge to get his fingers on the latest box of collector stamps!	They would repress dissents by cutting off their fingers and mailing them to relatives in small boxes (of course including stamps for proper postage).	JH	1	ヨク	おさ.える	抑える (おさ.える)

1838	ascend	Đăng	登	ascend, teepee, wigwam, beans, table, one, mouth	12	44	Teepee . . . table. Do not confuse with rise up (Frame 43).		When an American Indian warrior dies, his body is placed on a TABLE inside a TEEPEE, and a ritualistic ceremony is held to encourage his spirit to ASCEND to that big buffalo hunting ground in the sky.	When I was a kid I went out camping in a teepee. I ate beans for dinner, and afterwards I produced so much gas that my teepee actually ascended in the air!	3	3	トウ、ト、ドウ、ショウ、チョウ	のぼ.る、あ.がる	登壇 (とうだん), 登校 (とうこう), 登記 (とうき), 登る (のぼ.る)
1839	lucidity	Trừng	澄	lucidity, water, water droplets, water pistol, ascend, teepee, wigwam, beans, table, one, mouth	15	44	Water . . . ascend.		Scuba divers know that when you ascend in the water, your lucidity increases (For non-divers, the deeper you go, the more you become mentally impaired by nitrogen narcosis, every 50 feet is like drinking one martini). Scuba divers also know that as you ascend in the water, the lucidity of the water improves, too.	A few drops of acid/peyote and the Indians obtain lucidity on their vision quest, as if they were floating in the lucid sky.	JH	1	チョウ	す.む、す.ます、-す.ます	澄ます (す.ます), 澄む (す.む)
1840	discharge	Phát	発	discharge, teepee, wigwam, two, human legs	9	44	This key word refers to the discharging of guns, trains, people, and even words. The elements: teepee . . . two . . . human legs. Contrast the writing with frame 63.		Two pairs of human legs poking out of a teepee: you know there´ll be a discharge soon, be it sexual, violent (husband returns home with a weapon), or dishonourable (soldier caught molesting a native), or perhaps all of the above.	I spent some time in her TEEPEE...just the TWO of us...but I looked between her HUMAN LEGS and I saw a nasty DISCHARGE...so I made my 出発　rather hastily.	3	4	ハツ、ホツ	た.つ、あば.く、おこ.る、つか.わす、はな.つ	発明 (はつめい), 発射 (はっしゃ), 突発 (とっぱつ)

1842	colleague	Liêu	僚	colleague, person, pup tent, large, St. Bernard, sun, day, small, little	14	44	Person . . . pup tent. Choose some connotation of the key word that will keep it distinct for you from companion (Frame 19), friend (Frame 760), consort (Frame 1287), and comrade (Frame 1765).		Trivia: The right primitive is kagaribi - 尞 - fuel used for sacrifices. I would use sacred bonfire as a primitive . (Mnemonic: Top is a merged image of big and fire - big sacred bonfire that looks like little sun). Story: Your colleague got fired literally... in a sacred bonfire by Mr.T.	"Mr. T began working in a japanese compagny. As he sees that his colleague accept to do some extra work during the week-end and even sleep at the office, he says to them: ""I pity da fool who work during week-end! You might as well install a pup tent in the office and forget about your home""."	JH	1	リョウ		
1844	dormitory	Liêu	寮	dormitory, house, pup tent, large, St. Bernard, sun, day, small, little	15	44	House . . . pup tent.		This guy would rather use his pup-tent as a house, than sleep in the dormitory. So he effectively turned that pup-tent into a house by getting a postal address for it etc. (just to emphasize house).	A dormitory is right in the middle between living in a house and living in a pup tent.	JH	1	リョウ		
1845	heal	Liệu	療	heal, sickness, hospital, pup tent, large, St. Bernard, sun, day, small, little	17	44	Sickness . . . pup tent.		In Final Fantasy 4, sleeping in a tent completely heals you and recovers all your HP and MP (and cures any sickness your characters may have).	The sick caveman asks gods to heal him (from a hangover) and sets a sacred bonfire in his cave.	JH	2	リョウ		
1846	carve	Điêu	彫	carve, circumference, running track, glass hood, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, shape	11	45	The two primitives here, circumference and shape, belong naturally to the special connotations that differentiate carving from engraving (see frame 1639).		Start with a circumference and carve away until you get the shape you want.	A lathe is used to carve a shape with circumference into wood or metal.	JH	1	チョウ	ほ.る、-ぼ.り	彫る (ほ.る)
1847	shape	Hình	形	shape, two hands, shape	7	45	Two hands . . . shape.		Everyone in the kindergarten came up with fun and interesting shapes made out of Play-Doh, except for the kid with the amputated arm. Seems like you really need both hands.	With your two hands, outline the shape of a curvaceous woman. Is that a universally understood gesture? [Careful: mould (#680) which has two hands and soil/clay].	2	3	ケイ、ギョウ	かた、-がた、かたち、なり	形態 (けいたい), 形成 (けいせい), 図形 (ずけい), 形 (かた), 形 (かたち)

You're out hiking looking at the SCENERY, suddenly out of the corner of your vision you see a large SHADOW's indistinct SHAPE... could it be a grizzly? (cmp shade (#1592)).	JH	1	エイ	かげ	影 (かげ)
1849	Cedar	Sam, Soan	杉	cedar, tree, wood, shape	7	45	Tree . . . shape.		Cedar is an evergreen tree that keeps its SHAPE all year long. That is, it doesn´t loose its needles/leaves in the winter.	Cedar is a wood that keeps its shape. (This is true, it's rot resistant.).	JH	1	サン	すぎ	杉 (すぎ)
1850	coloring	Thái, thải	彩	coloring, claw, vulture, grab, tree, wood, shape	11	45	Vulture . . . tree . . . shape.		In Sydney we occasionally get exotic birds. You first notice a colouring in a tree.

The shape of a sheriff´s badge makes it patent who he is.	It was patently absurd when the fellow tried to arrest me--his badge was the wrong shape: a vase and a sunflower? Come now.	JH	1	ショウ

When I was a lad, a pretty face was all it took for someone to get in my head, and I´d fill pages of lovelorn letters to them.	2	3	ガン	かお	顔 (かお)
1854	ought	Tu	須	ought, shape, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	12	45	Shape . . . head. This is the only time that shape is placed to the left of its relative element, the head.		Why, I OUGHT to RESHAPE your HEAD...

It's rare to see the king carrying his own parasol - typically he gets one of his attendants to do it for him (thanks to Katsuo for umbrella + shape = parasol and to Peppi for the story idea).

The doctor at my checkup was expressing words of concern about my umbrella shaped gut.	JH	1	シン	み.る	診る (み.る)
1861	sentence	Văn	文	sentence, plaid, kilt, Billy Connolly	4	45	Under the familiar top hat we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it. It can be associated with sentence by thinking of a sentence as a grammatical pattern.	* The primitive meaning for this character will be plaid, the familiar crisscross pattern frequently used in textiles.	A twist on greenapple: The teacher puts a tophat on all pupils with gramatically correct sentences, while the rest are left with a big red X on their homework.	The teacher in the tophat puts an X on all the grammatically incorrect sentences.	1	4	ブン、モン	ふみ、あや	文学 (ぶんがく), 文化 (ぶんか), 作文 (さくぶん), 文 (ふみ)

The Scotsman goalkeeper adjusted himself. He reached down and adjusted the two things between his skinny fencepost legs.	"HINT: this kanji as a primitive can mean goalkeeper. The ""fence posts"" are goalposts, and the two goalkeepers wear plaid uniforms (this kanji also means uniform as in even), making them uniform with each other and distinguishing them as goalkeepers from the rest of the team."

The possessed girl is tied to two posts next to the altar, her head spinning around and around. Then the priest says the required sentence: ""The power of Christ compels you!"""

Note too, that the fourth stroke for rice is already taken care of by the fourth stroke of rake.		Even though it´s a maddening task, the monks stay solemn as they rake rice between the fenceposts.	Note: This is not sieve as it has a full rice and not rice grains and the hook is missing from rake. Also the given stroke order is incorrect (fenceposts should come last).	JH	1	シュク、スク	つつし.む	
1871	bases	Túc	塁	bases, rice field, brains, sparkler, soil, dirt, ground	12	45	The kanji of this frame refers to the four bases that are placed at the corners of a baseball infield. The elements: field . . . sparkler . . . ground.		Playing baseball in a rice field with sparklers stuck into the ground to act as bases.

1874	ratio	Xuất	率	ratio, mysterious, question mark, top hat, cocoon, sparkler, ten, needle	11	45	Mysterious . . . sparkler . . . ten. Do not confuse with proportion (Frame 1673).		Keep separate from proportion. Gandalf is trying to adjust the aspect ratio of his monitor from 4:3 to 16:9 so that he can watch Lord of the Rings in widescreen format. He's poking around the inside of his monitor with a magnesium needle when he causes a short circuit which sets his needle on fire making the needle look just like a sparkler.	It´s quite mysterious how each sparkler gives of sparkles at a precise ratio of ten to one. Physicists have been studying this effect for decades, known as the Sparkler Effect, and using it to explain why stars look like sparklers in the night sky.	5	1	ソツ、リツ、シュツ	ひき.いる	率先 (そっせん), 引率 (いんそつ), 軽率 (けいそつ), 率いる (ひき.いる)

If you eat something astringent water will stop the sparkly sensation in your mouth.	"I think that Heisig meant this as the ""slightly bitter but fresh"" meaning that it can have to describe foods like lemons (しぶい). So imagine a guy trying a cocktail (water), feeling like he´s been kicked in the face (footprint) and sparks are flying from his tongue. ´How did it taste?´. ´Hmm, yes, slightly bitter, but fresh""."

The two strokes of the dagger take the place of the middle stroke of little.	* As a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form. Elsewhere, the first two strokes are abbreviated to a single dot. This latter form will take the meaning of an apple.	He was stabbed with a dagger, and little drops of red blood dropped onto the ground.	There was red all over the soil after Little Red Riding Hood plunged a dagger into the wolf. Those two dots we see are wolfies animal legs we see, by the way (a la smithsonian).	1	4	セキ、シャク	あか、あか-、あか.い、あか.らむ、あか.らめる	赤道 (せきどう), 赤貧 (せきひん), 発赤 (はつあか), 赤 (あか), 赤い (あか.い), 赤らむ (あか.らむ), 赤らめる (あか.らめる)

1890	color	Sắc	色	color, bound up, mosaic	6	45	Bound up . . . mosaic.		Bound up in the Rubik´s cube are the 6 different colours.	Ever look closely at mosaics?

1894	sweet	Cam	甘	sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket	5	46	This kanji is a pictograph of a small wicker basket. (The extra short stroke in the middle helps keep it distinct from the character for twenty.) All one needs to add is some image of sweet cakes or breads carried in the basket, and the union of picture and meaning is complete. Take care not to confuse with confectionary (Frame 1203).	* As a primitive, the pictograph's meaning of a wicker basket is used, a small one like the kind used for picnics.	Little red riding hood is carrying around a wicker basket filled with sweet baked cookies for granny.	Girls are kinda sweet and sexy until they reach their twenties. So 20 minus ONE.	JH	2	カン	あま.い、あま.える、あま.やかす、うま.い	甘い (あま.い), 甘える (あま.える), 甘やかす (あま.やかす)
1895	navy blue	Cám (xanh đậm)	紺	navy blue, thread, spiderman, sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket	11	46	Thread . . . wicker basket.		Thanks raulir - As many Japanese perverts know, navy blue threads conceal school girl sweetness underneath.	Much like Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Spiderman failed to heed Willy Wonka´s warnings, and upon chewing on the 3 course meal chewing gum turned a very navy shade of navy blue.	JH	1	コン		
1896	so-and-so	Mô (~nào đó)	某	so-and-so, sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket, tree, wood	9	46	The key word here refers to the adjective for an unspecified person or thing. Its elements: wicker basket . . . tree.		I had the same idea as fuabrisu. A generic person is described here as having body sort of like a tree trunk and head sort of like a wicker basket.

1898	mediator	Môi (môi giới)	媒	mediator, woman, so-and-so, sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket, tree, wood	12	46	Woman . . . so-and-so.		In a divorce, the woman needs a mediator because she won't talk to that so-and-so. Imagine the woman on the ground and the so-and-so up in the tree, and the poor mediator climbing up and down, trying to mediate their fight.	The two little gossiping girls with their lollipops are having a fight. Now an adult woman (mom or teacher) has to come between them an serve as a mediator.	JH	1	バイ	なこうど	
1899	deceit	Khi	欺	deceit, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight, lack, yawn	12	46	Bushel basket . . . yawn.		Kasparov practices deceit by grabbing your rook while pretending to yawn.	Every day, a smuggler takes bushel baskets on donkeys across the border. But the border patrols can never arrest him for lack of evidence no matter how much they search the bushel baskets: they can´t find whatever he is smuggling. What was his deceit? He was smuggling donkeys!	JH	1	ギ	あざむ.く	欺く (あざむ.く)
1900	chess piece	Kỳ	棋	chess piece, tree, wood, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight	12	46	Tree . . . bushel basket.		Chess piece = wooden rook.	Ever seen those huge chess games in parks? The large wooden chess pieces need to be carted in a shopping trolley.	JH	1	キ	ご	
1901	national flag	Kỳ (quốc kì)	旗	national flag, banner, compass, direction reclining, lying down, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight	14	46	Banner . . . bushel basket.		The United Republic of Chess' national flag is actually a banner with a rook, that way they can hang it at every tournament.	The national flag is the banner of a country; stored in a whicker basket at night and taken out to the flagpole in the morning.	4	1	キ	はた	旗 (はた)
1902	period	Kì	期	period, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	12	46	Bushel basket . . . month. As the month indicates, this has to do with periods of time.		The slowest remote chess game ever: a one month period between every move.	The girl´s panties are all in the bushel basket as it´s that time of the month again... her period.	3	3	キ、ゴ		期間 (きかん), 期待 (きたい), 予期 (よき)
1903	Go	Kỳ	碁	go, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight, stone, rock	13	46	Bushel basket . . . stones. The key word refers to the Japanese game played with black and white colored stones on a lined board.		Go is chess played with stones.	The ignorant gaijin put a rook on top of his opponent´s stone when playing Go, much to the consternation of the Japanese players.	JH	1	ゴ

Fundamentals of chess: use the rooks to protect your ground.	A Bushel-basket full of earth contains the fundementals of farming. i.e. earth.	5	1	キ	もと、もとい	基 (もと), 基 (もとい)
1905	tremendously	Thậm (thậm chí, rất, lắm)	甚	tremendously, bushel basket, hamper, equal, human legs	9	46	Bushel basket . . . equal. Note how the first stroke of equal doubles up with the sixth stroke of the bushel basket, and how the animal legs of the bushel basket are dropped to make room for the human legs of equal.		It´s a tremendous match between the two chess-players. They are clearly eachother´s equal.	These two bushel baskets are tremendously huge. But not only they are huge, they are also perfectly equal in size.	JH	1	ジン	はなは.だ、はなは.だしい	甚だ (はなは.だ), 甚だしい (はなは.だしい)
1906	intuition	Khám (dò xét, tri giác)	勘	intuition, tremendously, bushel basket, hamper, equal, human legs, power, muscle, arnold	11	46	Tremendously . . . muscle.		Intuition is a tremendously powerful resource of the mind.	"Using Zareon´s story for the previous frame ""tremendously""... The two chessplayers who are eachother´s equals are so good at chess that they don´t have to even move a muscle. Their brain power does it for them. Furthermore, they don´t even have to think, really. Their intuition takes control. This is: extreme chess."	JH	1	カン		
1907	withstand	Kham	堪	withstand, soil, dirt, ground, tremendously, bushel basket, hamper, equal, human legs	12	46	Soil . . . tremendously.		Because I hid myself behind a huge dirt barrier I dug, I was able to withstand the tremendous nuclear blast.	Plain old soil can withstand tremendous amounts of pressure.	JH	1	カン、タン	た.える、たま.る、こ.らえる、こた.える	堪える (た.える)

1909	bequeath	Di	遺	bequeath, precious, Takanohana, purse, in, one, floor, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, road	15	46	Precious . . . road.		"Bilbo bequeathes the ""PRECIOUS"" to Frodo, who will carry it on the long ROAD to Mordor."	"Bequeath is an odd old word, isn´t it? Basically, it just deals with how I want my precious possessions dealt out, after I die, later down the road. ""Being of sound, but antiquated, mind, I bequeath this to you!""."	6	1	イ、ユイ	のこ.す	遺棄 (いき), 遺産 (いさん), 遺失 (いしつ)
1910	dispatch (phái tới)	Khiến	遣	dispatch, purse, in, one, floor, maestro without baton, road	13	46	This kanji takes away the maestro's baton and replaces it with a purse. The road represents his being dispatched on his way a san obvious misfit. You will remember that when he did have his baton, he was being chased down the road by his fans. All of which shows what a difference a single stroke can make!		Dispatch all cars and chase the maestro! He's gone crazy and stolen a ladies purse!	"Apart from meaning DISPATCH, this kanji can mean ""to give (to someone lower than you),"" ""to do,"" and to even ""have intercourse."" STORY: The MAESTRO is on the ROAD waiting for a pimp to DISPATCH some new ladies (lower than him) so that he can GIVE THEM money from his PURSE and then DO IT with them. Where is the MAESTRO´S baton? You don´t wanna know..."	JH	1	ケン	つか.う、-つか.い、-づか.い、つか.わす、や.る	遣う (つか.う), 遣わす (つか.わす)
1912	dance	Vũ	舞	dance, reclining, lying down, tub, sunglasses, dancing legs, ballerina, evening	15	46	The top two strokes show someone reclining, and the next six are a pictograph of an oaken tub ribbed with metal strips, like the kind once used for bathing. At the bottom, the sunglasses round off the character.		The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his shades while his personal harem dances naked for him.	I learned nothingness (#1775) first because it is a very common kanji. Probably easier to think of this kanji in that context. Attractive dancers should dance wearing nothing but sunglasses.	JH	3	ブ	ま.う、-ま.う、まい	舞い (ま.い), 舞う (ま.う)
1913	nothingness	Vô, mô	無	nothingness, reclining, lying down, tub, oven-fire, barbecue	12	46	This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: nothingness. Make use of the oaken tub from the previous frame, and add to that the oven fire at the bottom.		When I enter the wooden tub heated by flames in the onsen, I can let all my worries slip away and be submerged into nothingness.	In a hot tub you can relax and have your stress vanish into nothingness.	4		ム、ブ	な.い	無名 (むめい), 無理 (むり), 皆無 (かいむ), 無い (な.い)

The leader of the Spiderman association has tons of Spiderman figurines lined up on his shelf.

1915	coarse	Thô	粗	coarse, rice, shelf, my bookshelves	11	47	Rice . . . shelf.		Ugh, why does this shelf feel so coarse? Because it´s made of rice, of coarse! Get it? Of coarse?? Hahahahahahahahahah god i hate my life.	Refined rice [1535] can only be found in exclusive grocery shops. Coarse rice by contrast fills the supermarket shelves - don't go looking for anything else there.	JH	1	ソ	あら.い、あら-	粗い (あら.い)
1916	tariff	Tô (tô thuế)	租	tariff, wheat, cereal, shelf, my bookshelves	10	47	Wheat . . . shelf.		According to Henshall, this kanji originally represented the harvested rice (the wheat primitive) that farmers paid as a tithe. Its meaning today would seem to be very similar. Imagine the farmer putting aside some of his harvested wheat on a shelf in order to pay the tariff to his lord.	The EU and US impose such high tariffs on food imports that third world wheat (the most basic of staples) never reaches first world supermarket shelves.	JH	1	ソ		
1918	ancestor	Tổ	祖	ancestor, altar, shelf, my bookshelves	9	47	Altar . . . shelf.		The ancestor worship is so common in Daoist and buddhist countries that you can buy tiny altars to put on the shelves, one for each deceased family member.	The urns of ancestors are kept on shelves next to the altar.	5	3	ソ		
1919	thwart	Trở	阻	thwart, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, shelf, my bookshelves	8	47	Pinnacle . . . shelf.		Keeping porn on the pinnacle of a bookshelf can thwart snooping kids (thanks bodhisamaya).	The shortness of the Japanese thwarts their attempts to reach the topmost (pinnacle) shelf without grabbing a chair.	JH	1	ソ	はば.む	阻む (はば.む)
1920	investigate	Tra	査	investigate, tree, wood, shelf, my bookshelves	9	47	Tree . . . shelf.		A whole team of cops is sent to investigate how a tree could grow on top of a shelf with no soil or water.	The result of the inverstigation of the missing Trees? Why, most of them had become shelfs!	5	2	サ		
1921	help	Trợ	助	help, shelf, my bookshelves, power, muscle, arnold	7	47	Shelf . . . power. The reason why the shelf appears on the left here is that the right side is the normal position for power, the stronger primitive. Indeed, the only exception in all the kanji is the character for add (Frame 932).		HELP! Someone´s pinned under this bookshelf and it´s gonna take a lot of muscle to lift it off!	Can you help me move this shelf? I don´t have the muscle to do it alone.	3	3	ジョ	たす.ける、たす.かる、す.ける、すけ	助 (すけ), 助かる (たす.かる), 助ける (たす.ける)
1922	best regards	Nghi (thích nghi, tiện nghi)	宜	best regards, house, shelf, my bookshelves	8	47	This kanji, a polite way of expressing one's best regards to another. Its elements: house . . . shelf.		It seems like every time my Japanese friends send me their best regards, they accompany them with a gift. Over time, I´ve gotten so many that I had to buy a second house which contains nothing but several fancy shelves. Each shelf is dedicated to a certain friend of mine and contains every last one of their presents.	We have a shelf in our house where we put Christmas cards from people who send best regards for the holiday season...　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ギ　便宜主義　べんぎしゅぎ(opportunism).	JH	1	ギ	よろ.しい、よろ.しく	
1923	tatami mat	Điệp (chiếu ngủ)	畳	tatami mat, rice field, brains, crown, shelf, my bookshelves	12	47	Rice field . . . crown . . . shelf.		The king is peacefully sleeping on his new tatami mat when all of a sudden a shelf falls over and kills him. You can see his crown poking out and the brains splatter out the top of his head from all the pressure.	Making tatami mats from rice field waste was Japan´s crowning achievement, but for some reason other countries just shelved the idea.	JH	2	ジョウ、チョウ	たた.む、たたみ、かさ.なる	畳む (たた.む), 畳 (たたみ)
1924	row	Tịnh (xếp hàng)	並	row	8	47	This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for stand up. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.	* The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it. ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line. We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to upside down in a row.	This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of two people standing in a row.	"Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a rowing boat. In a rowing boat people sit in rows, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for ""rowboat"" coming at frame 1876. The rowing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for ""rowboat"" has a generic meaning of ""a small boat"". In any case, the kanji for ""rowboat"" will not appear as a primitive in the book."	6	2	ヘイ、ホウ	な.み、なら.べる、なら.ぶ、なら.びに	並 (なみ), 並びに (なら.びに), 並ぶ (なら.ぶ), 並べる (なら.べる)
1925	universal	Phổ (phổ thông)	普	universal, row, sun, day	12	47	Row . . . sun.		People at Universal Studios wait in rows so long that the sun goes down.	To me, row is way too close to file (#812), so I´m adopting Fab´s meaning of rowboat from the previous frame. Universal Studios went through a number of logo animations before settling on the one they are most famous for: the letters UNIVERSAL orbiting the Earth. One of the most ridiculous of these involved a man rowing himself in a boat around the sun.	JH	2	フ	あまね.く、あまねし	
1926	musical score	Phổ (phổ nhạc)	譜	musical score, say, words, keitai, mouth, universal, row, sun, day	19	47	Words . . . universal.		Musical scores are in a universal language.	A musical score can be read, but not like ordinary words. Music is a universal language.	JH	1	フ

You first wash you clothes with water and wring them until they are just damp before hanging them in a row under the sun to dry. If you don´t wring them damp first they will take days to dry!	If your things are damp, lay them up in a row under the sun and let the water evaporate. (thx Raichu)...　RTK2:　シツ　湿気　しっけ(humidity).	JH	2	シツ、シュウ	しめ.る、しめ.す、うるお.う、うるお.す	湿す (しめ.す), 湿る (しめ.る)
1928	appear	Hiển	顕	appear, sun, day, row, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	18	47	Sun . . . row . . . heads.		One day a row of Suns appeared in the sky, turning everyone's heads upwards.	Clouds were covering the sky for months now. Rows upon rows of people spent whole days with their heads turned upwards, waiting for sun to appear.	JH	1	ケン	あきらか、あらわ.れる	
1929	slender	Tiệm	繊	slender, thread, spiderman, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, row	17	47	Thread . . . Thanksgiving . . . row.		At the end of Thanksgiving it's tradition for everyone to stand in a row and measure their waist with a strip of thread. Whoever is the most slender wins the leftovers.	At the time of Thanksgiving, there´s a row of all sorts of food on the table, which you mustn´t eat if you want to stay as slender as a thread.	JH	1	セン		
1930	spirits	Linh	霊	spirits, rain, weather, two, row	15	47	"Rain . . . two . . . row. This character will refer only to the inhabitants of the ""spirit world,"" and not to moods or temperaments, for which we will learn another character in frame 2030."		After raining for two days in a row, you plead with the SPIRITS for some relief. (Adapted from johnskb,21-5-2006).	When it rains, two worlds come together and spirits can be seen in the forest, dancing in a row.	JH	1	レイ、リョウ	たま	霊感 (れいかん), 霊魂 (れいこん), 霊長類 (れいちょうるい), 霊 (たま)
1931	profession	Nghiệp	業	business, profession, upside down in a row, not yet, tree, wood	13	47	In a row upside down . . . not yet.		A truly gruesome profession: an abattoir worker. Where the carcasses are upside down in a row that have not yet been cut up into sausages and steaks.	A bunch of kids are hanging upside down in a row on the monkeybars. Naturally, they haven't chosen a profession, at least not yet.	3	4	ギョウ、ゴウ	わざ	業績 (ぎょうせき), 職業 (しょくぎょう), 卒業 (そつぎょう), 業 (わざ)
1932	slap	Bạc	撲	slap, finger, fingers, upside down in a row, husband	15	47	Fingers . . . upside down in a row . . . husbands.		After a row husbands take their wives upsides down over the knee and slap them with their fingers on the bottom (if that doesn´t get me banned…).	Here we have badly behaving HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW.

As a rule, it is a word that boys and men use to refer to themselves. Its elements: person . . . husbands . . . in a row upside down."		"Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig method, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it's the kanji for ""boku."" Males usually use either ""boku"" or ""ore"" (instead of ""watashi"") to refer themselves. ""Boku"" is slightly boyish and soft; ""ore"" is rough & tough. Mr. T would definitely use ""ore"" -- but when he's one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to ""boku"" when he pleads ""come on baby, it's ME!"""	Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. But when his wife comes up to punish him, he pleads, “It’s ME, Baby. I wasn’t behaving badly like these other foo’s.”.	JH	1	ボク	しもべ	
1934	together	Cộng	共	together, salad, animal legs, eight	6	47	Salad . . . animal legs.	* The primitive retains the meaning of together. Imagine things strung together like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with bushel basket, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.	The character for (#1939) gave me the idea to use together as a primitive for Noah's Ark. Noah kept plenty of salad on board to entice the animals with their animal legs to scurry on board together, two by two.	The conjoined twins, who are always together, have trouble eating together because one is a vegetarian, eating salad and the other is a avid meat eater, eating chicken legs.[Thanks fuaburisu!].	4	3	キョウ	とも、とも.に、-ども	共 (とも)

1946	well	Tỉnh	井	well	4	48	Recalling that there are no circular strokes, and that the shape of the square and the square within a square (Frame 630) have already been used, it should be relatively easy to see how this character can be consider a pictograph of a well.		I nearly died by falling in a well. Actually, on two separate occasions. I´m glad to see they´ve added these fence posts. Now the well will be much safer.	Have you ever seen an old fashioned japanese well? == http://cruises.about.com/od/southeastasiacruise1/ig/Osaka-Japan/Ancient-Well-at-Osaka-Castle.htm.	JH	1	セイ、ショウ	い	油井 (ゆい), 市井 (しせい), 井 (い)

1950	Asia	Á	亜	Asia, roman two, mouth	7	48	In this kanji, the abbreviation for Asia, you should be able to see the character for mouth behind the Roman numeral II.

1952	circle	Viên	円	circle, yen	4	48	This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it. The connection is that the yennies, like pennies, are circular in shape. In any case, the elements are: glass canopy . . . walking stick . . . one.		The shape of a Yen coin.	"A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge glass hood with his cane (using it as a lever), to get to just one yen coin.

If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for soil, which would prompt you to write it in improper order.	* As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-angles.	A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an angle.

I have a funnel attached to my laptop that takes my prof´s lecture and puts the words into a text file. The bigger the funnel, the more accurate the conversion, so picture a bunch of laptops with large, unwieldy funnels attached to the USB port.

You know it´s not supposed to be used for that!).	5	2	コウ		
1958	subscription	Cấu	購	subscription, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, funnel, cone, celery, again	17	48	Shells . . . funnel.

The argument here is a process of academic reasoning, not a personal quarrel or spat.

1969	code	Điển (điển tích)	典	code, bend, tool	8	48	We introduce this character here because of its connection to the book-related kanji treated above. It is based on the character for bend (frame 1256), whose last stroke is lengthened to coincide with the first stroke of the element for tool.		Coding is a tool which you can use to bend the computer to your will.	"Think ""codex"" (mnemonic help) or ""code of laws"", or even Leonardo Da Vinci´s code. Here I see a codex as a tool used to bend the masses into submission. Picture a huge codex book lifted down on crowds to bend them down in submission. Another: if you bend to the code without asking questions, you are a tool!"	4	1	テン、デン

1971	paper	Chỉ	紙	paper, thread, spiderman, family name	10	49	Thread . . . family name.		All that threads you to your family name is a piece of paper. (birth certificate).

Most japanese find it impossible to resist pushy businessmen in Japan when they push their damned business cards into your fingers.	Japan business etiquette tip: When someone hands you a business card, resist the impulse to fiddle around with it with your fingers, and by all means resist the urge to use the card to pick gunk from under your fingernails.

1995	son	Lang	郎	son, halo, good, drop, silver, city walls	9	49	Halo . . . city walls.		The daughter is a good girl that grows up to be a woman. The son is a good boy that grows up to defend the city walls.	A good son stays within the city walls so he can care for his parents…　RTK2:　ロウ　新郎　しんろう(bridegroom)…　Pure Group:　廊1852.	JH	1	ロウ、リョウ	おとこ	
1996	corridor	Lang	廊	corridor, cave, son, halo, good, drop, silver, city walls	12	49	Cave . . . son.		Your son plays in the corridor pretending he´s exploring a cave.	(ロウ) I think of the corridor found in the cave that Yoda made Luke Skywalker walk through as part of his Jedi training in Empire Strikes Back. It was in this corridor that Luke met Darth Vadar, cut off his head and found himself behind Darth Vadar´s mask. An early little hint that Luke was Darth Vadar´s son.	JH	1	ロウ		
1997	shield	Thuẫn (aka mâu thuẫn)	盾	shield, drag, ten, needle, eye	9	50	Dragging . . . ten eyes.		This is a magic shield with ten eyes which have the power to drag the victim towards it.	You paint 10 huge eyes on your shield to scare the enemy, but consequently your shield is so big and heavy that you have to drag it.	JH	1	ジュン	たて	盾 (たて)
1998	sequential	Tuần (tuần hoàn)	循	sequential, Nelson, column, going, line, shield, drag, ten, needle, eye	12	50	Line . . . shield.		"This is mostly used in the word 循環, ""circulation"" (of buses through their routes, of blood, etc). So I think of a column of little Roman soldiers with their shields marching sequentially through the veins of a person, as an anthropomorphization of the immune system."	"A column of shielded soldiers advancing sequentially to avoid revealing the size of their army (Think ""Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers"" from Star Wars)."	JH	1	ジュン		
1999	faction	Phái (trường phái)	派	faction, water, water droplets, water pistol, caveman, drag, person, rag	9	50	Water . . . drag . . . rag. Back in frame 1127 we indicated that this latter radical would come up once again, as it does in this and the following two frames.		Drag + rag gave me trouble until I came up with zombie for it. The zombie population became more diverse, separating into different factions. One of them being the water Zombies.	The radical faction is almost eliminated, sir. They´re living in the sewers dressed in rags and dragging their supplies.	6	1	ハ

2002	parcel post	Đệ (đệ trình, gửi đi)	逓	parcel post, drag, cornstalk, belt, road	10	50	Drag . . . cornstalk . . . belt . . . road.		(I prefer 2 towels over cornstalk and belt) - Have you ever wondered why your parcels always end up in such bad condition when you get them? Or why you never get them at all? That's because you've never looked at how they're actually delivered - each postman is given a load of parcel post and 2 towels to drag them down the road on.	Picture a crude drag-sled - in this case, made from cornstalks that have been belted together - filled with parcels, that the postman drags along behind him down the road along his delivery route.	JH	1	テイ	かわ.る、たがいに	
2003	grade	Đoạn	段	grade, staple gun, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	9	50	The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for staples with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a staple gun. To the right, missile.		This is a military-grade staple gun! It can be loaded with real missiles.	1st grade: staple gun, 9th grade: missiles.	6	3	ダン、タン		
2004	forge	Đoàn, đoán	鍛	forge, metal, gold, grade, staple gun, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	17	50	Metal . . . grade.

JH	1	タン	きた.える	鍛える (きた.える)
2005	empress	Hậu	后	empress, drag, one, ceiling, mouth	6	50	Drag . . . one . . . mouth.		The F word often comes out of the mouth of the empress.	The empress is cruel. Normally she´ll violently pull her servants by the ear when they´ve failed to follow orders. But one time she dragged this one guy around the palace by the mouth. She must have been really angry—ever since that moment, he´s never been seen again.	6	1	コウ、ゴ	きさき	
2006	phantasm	Ảo	幻	phantasm, cocoon, clothes hanger, coat hanger	4	50	Cocoon . . . clothes hanger.		You open your closet and find strange, glowing cocoons sitting on your clothes hangers... definitely a phantasm!	After the play, The Phantasm of the Opera hangs up his cape on a clothes hanger and returns to his cocoon to sleep.	JH	1	ゲン	まぼろし	幻 (まぼろし)
2007	director	Tư, ti (tư lệnh, công ty)	司	director, clothes hanger, coat hanger, one, mouth	5	50	Clothes hanger . . . one . . . mouth.		"The porn director has one big mouth. ""Don´t bother putting your clothes on a hanger, just get started.""."	The director sticks a clothes hanger in each actor´s mouth and hangs them from the ceiling until he needs them.	4	1	シ	つかさど.る	
2008	pay respects	Tứ	伺	pay respects, person, director, Ken Russel, clothes hanger, coat hanger, one, mouth	7	50	This honorific form of call on (Frame 534) is made up of: person . . . director.		If Mr. T gets a role in a film, he doesnt pay respects to the director, the director pays respects to Mr. T.	That person, being the director, is someone you need to pay your respects to.	JH	2	シ	うかが.う	伺う (うかが.う)
2009	parts of speech	Từ (ca từ, lời văn)	詞	part of speech, say, words, keitai, mouth, director, Ken Russel, clothes hanger, coat hanger, one, mouth, mouth2	12	50	The key word, parts of speech, refers to nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, and so on. The elements: words . . . directors.		"The big mouthed diretor is even picky about the parts of speech you use, shouting, ""More verbs! Less adjectives!"" and such all the time."	Parts of speech act as word directors, giving it meaning and indicating its correct placement and usage in grammar.	6	2	シ

My mouth hung open when I found out I was the heir to not only my father's scrapbooks, but he also left me as director of the company.	JH	1	シ		
2012	boat	Chu, châu	舟	boat	6	50	After the drop and the glass canopy, we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for mama (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.		I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story boat seen from the front. The glass canopy is the body of the boat. The drop on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the ceiling/floor between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the two drops in the middle are the lights on the decks.	Cinnabar (丹) colored boat, the extra drop signifying that the paint hasn´t dried yet. The stick represents the oars.	JH	2	シュウ	ふね、ふな-、-ぶね	舟 (ふね)
2013	liner	Bạc	舶	liner, boat, white, dove	11	50	The type of boat connoted by this key word is a large oceangoing liner. The important thing here is to work with the elements boat and dove to make an image distinct from that of the former frame. Don't count on size alone to distinguish the boat from the liner.		The most famous LINER is the Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sunk. Just imagine that huge LINER strucking an even huger mass of white ice.	A liner is to boat as an emperor (#261) is to a king (#255), or a chief (#967) is to a person (#951): in each case we need only add white to the latter in order to get the former.	JH	1	ハク		
2014	navigate	Hàng (hàng không, hàng hải)	航	navigate, boat, whirlwind, top hat, wind	10	50	Boat . . . whirlwind.		"To navigate a ""boat"" through a ""whirlwind"" takes a skilled navigator."	In Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, you can navigate your boat by summoning whirlwinds.	4	2	コウ		
2016	carrier	Ban	般	carrier, boat, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	10	50	Boat . . . missile.		"Carrier?! This means ""general"" (as in the general public or generally). OK.. Carriers, i.e. boats with missiles, are not available to the general public."	In general, carrier boats have missiles.	JH	2	ハン		
2017	tray	Bàn	盤	tray, carrier, boat, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch, dish	15	50	Carrier . . . dish.		"What do you call a ""CARRIER"" of DISHes? A TRAY."	Imagine a restaurant set in Disney´s Fantasia or maybe in Harry Potter´s university, where dishes are magically landing and taking off of a carrier tray.	JH	1	バン		
2018	conveyor	Ban	搬	conveyor, finger, fingers, carrier, boat, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	13	50	Fingers . . . carrier.		When workers neglect workplace safety, their fingers get cut off and carried away by the conveyor belt, which looks like a ´finger carrier´ in that case.	During WWII, morse code was the primary means of communication from sea. The morse code specialist was the conveyor of messages to and from the crew of the carrier, using his fingers to tap out the secret messages. (This works especially well for 搬送周波数 carrier frequency and 搬送波 carrier wave, being the radio waves/frequencies used in morse code).	JH	1	ハン		
2019	ship	Thuyền	船	ship, boat, gully, eight, mouth	11	50	Boat . . . gully.		A boy floats his toy boat in a gully and imagines it as an immense ship.	"Aargh, hard to keep this separate from boat. How about this: the phrase ""shape up or ship out!"" This phrase originally meant that a soldier had better get his act together, or else face being shipped off into a combat zone. Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been shipped off to a combat zone. He´s riding in the boat overseas to fight in the trenches (gulley)."	2	3	セン	ふね、ふな-	船 (ふね)
2020	warship	Hạm	艦	warship, boat, oversee, retainer, slave, reclining, lying down, one, floor, dish	21	50	Boat . . . oversee.		The warship towers over the smaller benign boats, overseeing their safe path from port to port.	A warship is a boat that oversees the seas. Think of it as the patroller of the ocean.	JH	1	カン		
2021	rowboat	Đình	艇	rowboat, boat, courts, porter, drop, samurai, stretch	13	50	Boat . . . courts.		In venice, the boat used by the courts to transport criminals is a rowboat.	Courts in olden times would often punish convicts by sentencing them to a life of being the rower crew for large rowboat ships (there were no engines or boilers back then)... Yo ho, Yo ho....	JH	1	テイ		
2022	melon	Qua	瓜	melon, claw, vulture, elbow	6	50	The only thing that distinguishes this from the claw is the addition of the elbow, made by doubling up the third stroke and adding a fourth.		何これ???? ok, sorry to be crude... if you claw at a girls melons, she is gonna give you the elbow.	Vegetarian vultures are fighting for a melon, each trying to elbow its way to it with claws.	Names		カ、ケ	うり	
2023	arc	Hồ	弧	arc, bow, melon, claw, vulture, elbow	9	50	Bow . . . melon.		When you use a bow to shoot a melon, the arc varies depending on how far away you are.	"Joan of Arc (""arc"" also means ""bow"" in french) is practicing with a bow, shooting at melons in a distant field."	JH	1	コ		
2024	orphan	Cô	孤	orphan, child, melon, claw, vulture, elbow	9	50	Child . . . melon.		An orphan will never know the joys on sucking on his mother´s melons........	Unlike the celebrated story of Momotaro the peach boy, no one knows the story of the melon boy who was left an orphan.	JH	1	コ		
2025	cocoon	Kiến	繭	cocoon, flowers, hood, stick, thread, spiderman, insect	18	51	Though it's a good thing that the primitive for cocoon has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm (insect) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the flowers), digests them and transforms them into thread with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the hood). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception.		This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a cocoon. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (insect). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the insect covered with thread, making a beautiful cocoon.	The magic flower is the reason why Spider-Man ended up miniaturized and confined inside a hood-like cocoon together with an insect. Now, only a walking stick separates them both.	JH	1	ケン	まゆ、きぬ	繭 (まゆ)
2026	benefit	Ích	益	benefit, animal horns, one, floor, animal legs, eight, dish	10	51	Poised over the dish here is a pair of animal horns that are attached to a pair of animal legs by a single horizontal stroke.		The benefit of having sharp horns and fast legs is that an animal can get to the food dish first.	The benefit of being an animal with horns and fast legs is in keeping it from becoming a dish for the other animals! (shaydwyrm).	5	1	エキ、ヤク	ま.す	有益 (ゆうえき), 利益 (りえき), 益する (まする), 益 (やく)
2027	spare time	Hạ (nhàn hạ)	暇	spare time, sun, day, hobby, staples, mouth, box, crotch, box2	13	51	"The element for day on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see staples being held in mouth (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's spare time. The small box at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly ""inside out."" Finally, we have the crotch at the bottom."		Some jackass-like people have way too much spare time. You can find video´s of them all over the internet, if you like such things, you can watch it all day. You see them stapling their mouths shut, or throwing eachother upside down in boxes or kicking each other in the crotch.	"Tip: The complex right side of this kanji appears twice more in Heisig. He later names it ""hobby"". REF: shrimp (#2689), haze (#2779)."	JH	1	カ	ひま、いとま	暇 (ひま)
2028	spread	Phu	敷	spread, arrowhead, rice field, brains, compass, direction, taskmaster	15	51	At the top we have the arrowhead whose vertical line joins it to the rice field (or brains) below it. Beneath it, the compass; and to the right, the taskmaster.		Instead of being glued to one specialty (#46) 専, I decided to spread my attention in many directions 方, and be a taskmaster at none.	Arrowheads are spread all over the field. The taskmaster profiteerer forces you to find them all using a compass.	JH	1	フ	し.く、-し.き	敷く (し.く)
2029	come	Lai (tương lai)	来	come, not yet, animal horns	7	51	This odd but common kanji is built up of the character for not yet into which a pair of animal horns has been inserted.		You horny bastard, don´t come, at least not yet!	"Here I see, of all things, Bambi. His animal horns have not yet come out. (As we can see in the kanji, the animal horns are not at the top, not ""poking through"". ) Remember: Bambi will soon come to have a great set of animal horns but they have not yet come out."	2	5	ライ、タイ	く.る、きた.る、きた.す、き.たす、き.たる、き、こ	来す (きた.す), 来る (きた.る), 来る (く.る)
2030	spirit	Khí	気	spirit, landed fish, reclining, lying down, one, floor, fishhook, sheaf	6	51	The spirit in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: reclining . . . floor . . . fishhook . . . sheaf. Do not confuse with spirits (Frame 1930).		You´re reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you´ve been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning spirit.	Captain Hook, his spirit crushed, is lying on the ground cursing Wolverine who has defeated him with his far superior claws.	1	5	キ、ケ	いき	気体 (きたい), 気候 (きこう), 元気 (げんき)
2031	vapor	Khí	汽	vapor, water, water droplets, water pistol, landed fish, reclining, lying down, one, floor, fishhook	7	51	Think of this character as a sibling of that for spirit. Simply replace sheaves with drops of water on the left in order to get vapor.		Water vapor almost looks like a spirit but has no soul.	Wolverine disappears into water vapor, seemingly his spirit dissipating into nothingness.	2	1	キ		
2032	fly	Phi	飛	fly, hook, propeller, measuring box, thousand, needles, propeller2	9	51	The two large hooks have little propellers (the two drops on each hook) attached to them for flying. Beneath is the measuring box, which serves as the body of this flying contraption. The stroke order will cause some problems, so take care with it.		Hooks with small wings attached look like hummingbirds with a long beak. Two hummingbirds are trying to fly away with our little measuring box. What do they want it for?	Two hummingbirds flying into a measuring box serving as a bird feeder…　RTK2:　ヒ　飛行機　ひこうき(airplane).	4	3	ヒ	と.ぶ、と.ばす、-と.ばす	飛ばす (と.ばす), 飛ぶ (と.ぶ)
2033	sink	Trầm	沈	sink, water, water droplets, water pistol, garter, crown, human legs	7	51	The technique for sinking used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a crown tied about one leg before the unfortunate party is tossed into the water.		(thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she sinks. She shouldn´t have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend´s schemes.	"This is the famous story of Archimedes and the Crown, where buoyancy was discovered. Watching the crown sink in the water, Archimedes detected the fraud and ran naked through the city (human legs distorted from running) yelling ""Eureka! Eureka!"" See http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29."	JH	2	チン、ジン	しず.む、しず.める	沈む (しず.む), 沈める (しず.める)
2035	wife	Thê	妻	wife, ten, needle, rake, woman	8	51	Ten . . . rakes . . . woman.		Ten rakes woman. your wife digs her fingernails into you and it feels like 10 rakes when she finds you ontop of another woman.	"(I´m really not sexist, this just helps me remember the kanji): I make my WIFE do all the yard work, and as a really mean joke, I bought her TEN RAKES for her birthday this year. ""Do the yardwork, WOMAN! You have TEN perfectly good RAKES to choose from!""."	5	3	サイ	つま	妻 (つま)
2037	decline	Suy	衰	decline, pathetic, stick, top hat, scarf, mouth	10	51	Let this key word connote the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a top hat and scarf, trying hard to look happy by putting a walking stick in his mouth sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.		If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical.	If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, allowing people to rent him and play catch with him for money!	JH	1	スイ	おとろ.える	衰える (おとろ.える)
2038	inmost	Trung	衷	inmost, ten, needle, mouth, scarf	9	51	Between the top hat and the scarf you will see the character for in which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the scarf. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the in (the walking stick in the mouth) was set on its side; here it is set upright.		The guy from pathetic (#401) shared his inmost feelings with a girl and she rammed a walking stick down his throat. It ruptured his inmost organs.	Besides making money from acting like a dog (see decline), the pathetic man has risked his inmost internal organs by becoming a cane swallower!	JH	1	チュウ		
2039	mask	Diện	面	mask, hundred, one, ceiling, drop, pent in, eye	9	51	Imagine a mask over your head with eyes peeping out from all over the head, a hundred in all (the element for eye displacing the fifth stroke of that for hundred).		If you´re wearing a mask, a hundred eyes can look at you but none of them will know who you are.	When Jim Carrey puts on The Mask, he can make it seem like he has 100 eyes popping out of his head.	3	3	メン、ベン	おも、おもて、つら	面 (おも), 面 (おもて), 面 (つら)
2041	leather	Cách	革	leather, flowers, car, mouth, ten, needle	9	51	After the flowers at the top (painted on the leather for decoration), we see the element for car with the middle stroke left out. Think of the seats having been taken out so that they can be reupholstered with this decorated leather.		I asked the street vendor the price of the LEATHER jacket. He said TWENTY, but with my MOUTH, I talked him down to TEN. (correct stroke order).	You can feed twenty mouths for a year for the price of ten leather coats.	6	2	カク	かわ	革 (かわ)
2042	shoes	Ngoa	靴	shoes, leather, flowers, car, mouth, ten, needle, change, person, spoon, sitting on the ground	13	51	Leather . . . change.		Leather shoes are nice because they change shape to fit your foot.	Leather is often changed into shoes.	JH	3	カ	くつ	靴 (くつ)
2043	hegemony	Bá	覇	hegemony, old west, leather, flowers, car, mouth, ten, needle, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	19	51	Old West . . . leather . . . moon.		In the Old West, cowboys had hegemony OVER the Indians despite their leathercraft and ability to navigate by the moon.	In the old west, animal skins were made into leather and their flesh was eaten, thus using the whole animal, which viewed from the animal side could be taken as humans asserting complete hegemony over them. All your base are belong to us.	JH	1	ハ、ハク	はたがしら	
2044	voice	Thanh	声	voice, samurai, flag, stick	7	51	The samurai at the top is familiar enough. The combination beneath, which looks like a flag with a line running through it, is not. Try to devise some way to take note of it, and pay attention to the writing.		When an enemy's flag is raised, a true samurai can split it in half with just his voice.	Having lost his voice, the samurai comunicated to his troops with a striped flag.	2	3	セイ、ショウ	こえ、こわ-	声楽 (せいがく), 声援 (せいえん), 名声 (めいせい), 声 (こえ)
2046	give	Ngô	呉	give, mouth, chair, tool, animal legs	7	51	The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The mouth and tool are already familiar.		As a present, I gave my dentist a hand-crank tool for spreading mouths. He was so happy since it makes his job easier.	I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a tool with a crank which plays music out of the bell mouth. Imaginge giving one of these old and beautiful phonographs to a classical or jazz music buff!	JH	1	ゴ	く.れる、くれ	
2047	recreation	Ngu	娯	recreation, woman, give, mouth, chair, tool, animal legs	10	51	Woman . . . give.		A man from a less enlightened society comes for a visit, and asks the host to give him a woman for some recreation.	"Typical male fantasy of recreation: women ""giving it up""."	JH	1	ゴ		
2048	mistake	Ngộ	誤	mistake, say, words, keitai, mouth, give, mouth, chair, tool, animal legs, mouth2	14	51	Words . . . give.		"It is a rookie mistake to believe the words when your sweetie says ""You don't have to give me anything for my birthday."" Trust me, your sweetie wants something, something shiny, and if you disappoint, you will suffer."	You must give words of apology when you make a mistake.	6	3	ゴ	あやま.る、-あやま.る	誤る (あやま.る)
2049	steam	Chưng	蒸	steam, flowers, helping hand, complete, water, one, floor, oven-fire, barbecue	13	51	The flower at the top and the floor with the oven fire beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for complete, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of water.		This kanji is used in compounds for the steaming of food and also for smoking/fumigation. Here we have the Japanese once again trying to replicate the French cuisine, only with a twist, steaming food with flowers (think of flower-smoked ham for example). Flowers must first be completely soaked in water, and then poured over a thin piece of flooring under which there is an oven fire.	When you want to steam some flowers/vegetation you don't cover them completely with water, rather you have just a little at the floor of the saucepan and then heat.	6	2	ジョウ、セイ	む.す、む.れる、む.らす	蒸す (む.す), 蒸らす (む.らす), 蒸れる (む.れる)
2050	acquiesce	Thừa (thừa nhận)	承	acquiesce, water, complete, three	8	51	The sense of passive acceptance or reception of information is contained in this key word. The form is based on the middle portion of the preceding character, with three additional strokes, best thought of as the kanji for three.

In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is decayed (see story for decay (#1243)) so you catch no prey.

2053	tusk	Nha	牙	tusk	4	52	If you play with this primitive's form with pencil and paper, you will see that it begins with a box-like shape, and ends with the final two strokes of the halberd, a convenient combination for the tusk protruding from the mouth of an animal.	* Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4 - but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056.	The kanji looks like an elephant with tusks. the box is the elephant´s eye. The final stroke is the tusk.	He stored the tusks into a box, along with the broken halberds.	JH		ガ、ゲ	きば、は、きばへん	牙 (きば)

This mnemonic is meant to join RtK´s keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used ""elegant"" here, which is not confounded so easily with graceful (#721), and accurately represents the character´s meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha´s Kanji Learner´s Dictionary)."	"To not confuse it with grace (#606) or graceful (#721), think of the phrase ""Goodness gracious."" Like: ""Goodness gracious! A turkey with tusks!""."	JH	1	ガ	みや.び

Animal track primitive: As expected, animal tracks were left in place of the trail of rice I´d purposely dropped the night before.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29.	JH	1	ハン		
2062	fur	Mao	毛	fur	4	52	This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of hand to produce fur. If you reverse your hand and put its palm down, you will have the side on which fur grows.		I´ve heard of people having hair on the back of their hands, but this is ridiculous!

2067	do	Vi (bởi vì)	為	do, so, strange building, tail feathers	9	52	This character rightly belongs to the previous lesson, but we held it until now because of the final element, the tail feathers. After the drop at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention.		"In this kanji, you can see 3 katakana characters: ソ, ユ, and then ユ again followed by TAIL FEATHERS. STORY: ""So (ソ) you (ユ) wanna DO it?""

Above its relative primitive, it is abbreviated form will mean hair. Further abbreviated, it will mean the long, mangy mane of an animal.	The top of this one reminds me of the staple primitive. So here´s my story: The girl´s hair was so long that she had to use staples instead of hairpins. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.	The Geisha with long hair uses an ornate lacquered hairpin to bundle it all up.	2	5	チョウ	なが.い、おさ	長い (なが.い)

2076	miss	Tang (tang lễ)	喪	miss, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, hairpin, safety-pin, mouth2	12	52	Soil . . . two mouths . . . hairpin. Hint: see spit (Frame 162). The key word carries the wide range of meanings readily associated with it: error, loss, absence, and so on.		"I miss my parents dearly. Here they lay, under a big cross, their mouths side by side. I stick hairpins in their graves. CAREFUL: the stroke order/primitive order is: ten, L mouth, R mouth, hairpin. ""Soil"" is not drawn in its stroke order."	"This kanji means miss as in ""miss a (dearly departed) person"", not as in ""miss a target"".　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Here the dearly departed has been buried in the ground, with her favourite hairpin in place of a gravestone, and two mourners stand around crying with open mouths."	JH	1	ソウ	も	喪 (も)

Knowing ZEN’s emphasis on “nothingness,” it’s not hard to envision a ZEN ALTAR being quite clean and SIMPLE.	"Simple-minded blond girl (see frame 1928) is very good at Zen, which isn´t surprising since she doesn´t think much. She has this bad habit of meditating perched on the main temple altar, which infuriates the Zen buddhists.

2087	chain	Toả (phong toả)	鎖	chain, metal, gold, small, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	18	53	Metal . . . little . . . shells. We have saved this character until no win order to draw attention to the visual difference between the owl and little.

2090	game hunting	LIỆP	猟	game hunting, pack of wild dogs, anemometer, owl, wind, cornstalk	11	53	Pack of wild dogs . . . owl . . . wind . . . cornstalk.		The WILD DOGS are GAME HUNTING the OWL who flies like the WIND through the CORN STORKS.	[game-hunting; shooting; game; bag] According to unicode.org and wwwjdic, 鼡 and 鼠 (mouse (#2065)) are variants. So, for 鼡 (which I´ll call rat) I have: an owl, flying in the wind, can easily spot a rat even if it´s hiding in the cornstalks. Now 猟 is easy: wild dogs are having fun by game-hunting rats.	JH	1	リョウ、レフ	かり、か.る	
2091	bird	ĐIỂU	鳥	bird, white, dove, one, tail feathers	11	53	Dove . . . one . . . tail feathers. This is, of course, the character from which we derived the primitive meaning of dove.

This kanji is not limited to the chirp of a bird, but stands for the sound of any kind of animal. Picture a very weird bird that can imitate with its mouth (a bird with mouth, heh) the voice of many different animals: Meeow! Woof! Mooo! Cuack!!! (Maybe the bird has Kirby powers and obtains the abilities of the animals it eats).	2	3	メイ	な.く、な.る、な.らす	鳴く (な.く), 鳴らす (な.らす), 鳴る (な.る)
2093	crane	HẠC	鶴	crane, turkey house, bird	21	53	Turkey house . . . bird. The first element appears on only one other occasion, back in frame 609.		"The original version of the ""Ugly Duckling"" was about a crane who grew up in a turkey coop. All the other birds made fun of it for not having a wattle or a snood or fanning its tail..."	I ordered a crane to move my turkey coop, but they sent me this damn bird instead.	JH	1	カク	つる	鶴 (つる)
2094	crow	Ô	烏	crow, drop, mouth, one, tail feathers	10	53	The only thing that distinguishes this character from that for bird is the omission of the one stroke that makes it white. Which is logical enough, when you consider that there are no crows of that color.		The book´s story is just fine, but I found a kanji dictionary explanation also interesting: As crows are all black, it´s hard to see where their eyes are (black on black), so a stroke is removed from the part in the pictograph where the eyes would be.	A crow is a bird, but not a white one. MEANING: write bird, but skip writing one in white.	Names		ウ、オ	からす、いずくんぞ、なんぞ	
2095	vine	ĐIỂU	蔦	vine, flowers, bird	14	53	Flower . . . bird.		In the jungle there is a flowery vine called hedera rhombea that attracts humming birds by the dozens. They scoot around the flowers sucking up nectar off the vine.	"Note : if you´ll remember we already have a primitive for ""ivy"", but it was completely made up from the ""square jewel"" kanji. The kanji here refers to ivy, or vine, and is used in a particular compound for ""Hedera rhombea"", which is a type of ivy native to Japan. This vine here produces a lot of flowers, and attracts many small birds, which is sure to cheer up even the most depressed Japanese gardener."	Names	1	チョウ	つた

2098	island	ĐẢO	島	island, bird, mountain	10	53	The bird's tail is tucked under here, because it has come to stop on a mountain to rest from its journey across the waters. Thus the kanji comes to mean an island.		This island is the home of the terrible mythical bird Roc. It sits mighty atop the mountain waiting for the next hapless ship to pass by.	Birds living on remote mountainous islands have few preditors. Tail feathers aren´t really needed are they? Evolutionary process at work!...　RTK2:　トウ　半島　はんとう(peninsula).	3	2	トウ	しま	島 (しま)

Its elements are: sun . . . migrating ducks.		Ducks migrate south for the winter... they follow the warmth of the sun.	A massive group of migrating ducks is blocking the warmth of the sun as they pass over your house/barbecue/picnic. Their formation is so humongous they block the warmth for a good 10 minutes while they pass over. Mnemonic for the migrating ducks primitive : the migrating ducks stick together like the best of friends, flying together as one (fifth stroke), they are not easy prey for the great eagles / vultures.	6	1	ダン、ノン	あたた.か、あたた.かい、あたた.まる、あたた.める	暖か (あたた.か), 暖かい (あたた.かい), 暖まる (あたた.まる), 暖める (あたた.める)

2106	interview	NGỘ	遇	interview, talking cricket, brains, insect, belt, road	12	53	Talking Cricket . . . road.		I was finally able to score an interview with the wisest being around: Jiminy Cricket. However, his schedule is really packed, so they had to squeeze me in while his tour bus rode between gigs. In fact, it was really short---after a few miles I was kicked out of the bus and stranded in the middle of the interstate. But man, it was worth it!

The only beast that could possibly climb it is a mountain goat of course.	This reminds me of a cartoon I saw once, perhaps it was with Donald Duck. he is startled and furious when he chases this mountain billygoat further and further up the mountain road, untill the angle is so steep that he finds himself inverted. And falls down, while the goat stands solidly placed inverted and laughs a goaty laughter as Donald plumments and makes that typical Donald shaped cartoon crater at the bottom.	5	2	ギャク、ゲキ	さか、さか.さ、さか.らう	逆 (さか), 逆らう (さか.らう)

So kitsch you just can´t forget it .	"This has the same meaning as 丘, so my ""Mount"" is a hill with mountain goats on it under a glass canopy. It´s obviously an effort by the locals to add some Mount atmosphere to their hill. As a primitive, it has the meaning ""sturdy"" (really), which Heisig has not used for some reason, but I will. The glass canopy must be pretty sturdy to keep the goats inside (bulletproof glass, I´m sure)."	JH		コウ	おか	岡 (おか)

Anything sturdy in Japan is associated with Mount Fuji. Perhaps this is because it´s symmetry is believed to make it rather sturdy itself, unlike all those crooked mountains that are around and tend to fall apart (think rock slides, avalanches, etc.). Here we see Sturdy-brand sabers with Mount Fuji engraved on the blade.	JH	1	ゴウ

It was a famous skunk, the one with the familiar silver stripe. The feet of the crowd rushing from the ceremony site churned up the soil very nicely. The ceremony was ruined but the groundbreaking was a great success.	I got sprayed by a skunk, so no one is helping me with the groundbreaking of my farm.

2126	excuse	MIỄN	免	excuse, village stocks, rabbit, bound up, human legs	8	53	This character is used for excusing oneself for a failure of courtesy. The elements are: bound up . . . sun (oddly enough, laid on its side) . . . human legs.	* For the primitive meaning, we shall refer to this character as a rabbit, for which the old form of the character is 兔.	Obviously this is the rabbit from Alice, excusing himself and rushing away on his legs, as he has a binding day schedule. This is at the same time an image, with bound=ears, day=head and legs are just legs. The image is used in rabbit (#2093).	What is the rabbit´s excuse for being such a jerk? Well he was bound up for a whole day while being stepped on by peoples human legs in some make-up labratory. Yeah I think I can excuse him after knowing that.	JH	1	メン	まぬか.れる、まぬが.れる	免れる (まぬか.れる)

2132	horse	Mã	馬	horse, team of horses	10	54	Let the extra vertical stroke in the mane combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the horse's long neck. The only odd thing is the tail feathers at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of mane and the first of tail feathers coincide should no longer surprise you.	* As a primitive, this kanji will mean a team of horses as distinct from the single horse whose primitive we met earlier.	"Turkey with the drops at the top removed and tail feathers added (this matches stroke order and there are the tail feathers already, why not have the whole bird). If you take the two drops of 隹 as wings, then horses are like turkeys, but have no wings and have more prominent tail ""feathers"". Both are actually supposed to be pictographs, though."	"The top part is half a comb (see frame 1920) with an extra vertical stroke to account for a sturdier version used to comb a horse mane. As a primitive I used the theme of the Trojan Horse. Not the modern computer viruses, but the large wooden horse which led to the demise of Troy and of the Trojans. Either its size (much greater than a live horse), or the fact that it conceals things into its belly, will set it appart from the horse primitive that came in frame 568 (""noon"")."	2	3	バ	うま、うま-、ま	馬 (うま)

Parking in the dark may be difficult...specially if you're parking a trojan horse. To lend you a tiny bit of help, take this candlestick with you, and at least you'll have some light.	In the olden days parking lots used to have reserved spaces for where the lord (of the set of houses, shops, whatever) could park his team of horses. nowadays it´s pretty much the same...reserved parking in front for the big bosses´ cars....

2138	station	DỊCH	駅	station, team of horses, shaku-hachi, flag, stick	14	54	Team of horses . . . shakuhachi.		Anyone living in Japan knows that train stations play little melodies when the train is about to arrive. In Ye Olden Days, when horses and carriages were used for transport, the carriage driver would play a little melody on his shakuhachi to let the passengers know the carriage was arriving at the next station.

The hidden Greeks inside the Trojan Horse are getting boisterous as one of them is bitten in the crotch by a nasty insect. If they don't shut up, the Trojans will hear them...	Or more precisely: the team of horses are getting boisterous because one of them got bitten in the crotch by a horse fly. The kanji also means to roar, make up noise, to kick up a fuss and to make merry. Perhaps it is exactly the etymology behind this kanji.	JH	1	ソウ	さわ.ぐ、うれい、さわ.がしい	騒ぐ (さわ.ぐ)
2140	burdensome	ĐÀ	駄	burdensome, team of horses, plump, large, St. Bernard, drop	14	54	Team of horses . . . plump.		If a passenger is too plump and heavy, its too burdensome for the horse.	If your horses get so plump to be good for nothing they just become burdensome.	JH	1	ダ、タ

"This is another word for surprise. 驚く＝おどろく= surprise. The Trojans stood in awe of the magnificent Trojan Horse that they thought was a gift. But imagine their surprise (wonder) when a bunch of Greeks came rushing out of it! (To further cement the connection between the primitives, if needed: It´s a wonder that the Trojans managed to speak keigo 敬語 even then, saying ""わたくしたちを殺さないでください!!お願い致します!!"")."	JH	1	キョウ	おどろ.く、おどろ.かす	驚かす (おどろ.かす), 驚く (おどろ.く)

2145	tiger	HỔ	虎	tiger, magic wand, augury, cliff, hook, diced, seven, human legs	8	54	The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the magic wand) who decided to make a tiger. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (diced into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated tiger promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless human legs). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for zoo (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the tiger somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for zoo.	* As a primitive element itself, the human legs are also swallowed up, but the meaning of tiger is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the tiger something else to eat.	Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt (皮) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn´t like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a tiger pelt - but things go awry when the tiger promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard).	"Tigger, the tiger, (from Pooh stories) is happy to have found a magic wand. Using it he can bounce up to a the top of a cliff, seven times as high as some human legs could bounce. Tigger thinks ""Its great to be a tiger!"	JH	1	コ	とら	虎 (とら)

2147	skin	PHU	膚	skin, tiger, stomach, rice field, brains, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	15	54	Tiger . . . stomach.		Ending up in a tiger´s stomach is not good for your skin, as it´s full of stomach acids.	"They say, ""there's more than one way to skin a cat"", but if you try to skin a tiger you might end up in its stomach."	JH	2	フ	はだ	
2148	void	HƯ	虚	void, tiger, row	11	54	Tigers . . . row.		In Japanese folklore there is no hell, but there is the void.

A giant E, for EVIL, of course.	"The ""E"" shape actually means claws here, and the real etymology is a tiger tyrannizing other animals with its claws (the etymologies actually make sense once in a blue moon!).

2154	deer	LỘC	鹿	deer, cave, antlers, compare, spoon, sitting on the ground, spoon2, sitting on the ground2	11	54	"Drawn on the walls of a complex of caves near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of deer, some of them showing men in deer masks. By comparing their drawings to real deer, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by comparing themselves to the deer, to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a ""double-key"" (the extra stroke through the element for key) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which caves, a double-key, and comparing gives us the kanji for deer."	* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the tiger was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: painting of a deer.	Bambi wanders into a cave and sees a side order of salad and 2 spoons...but what´s the main course?	Santa´s reindeer, Rudolf, opens a nightclub in a cave. It´s popular with all the deer and reindeer in the world. The cave speciality is a salad w/ dressing on the side.

Note the doubling up in these last two elements as in frame 2091.		For tonight's dinner (says the waiter) I would recommend the Deer. It is very special because it has been fed with flowers all it's life, has been killed with a slingshot (so there is no gun powder in it) and right now it is in the cooking fire. The meaning: recommend; mat; advise; encourage; offer.	It is recommended that deers stick to eating flowers. If they try to eat birds, they may end up choking on them, like this one here. Note that the head (白) is gone and the visible part of the body which is normally written with a stroke of the head must by necessity be drawn with a stroke of the tail.	JH	1	セン	すす.める	薦める (すす.める)

You may recall that we met the relative primitives at the bottom here before, in the kanji for melancholy (Frame 663).		"The hunter experienced jubilation when the deer with melancholy walked up to him and said, ""just shoot me, whats the point in running. Everyone dies someday..."""	Bambi was melancholy at the death of his mother, but is now in jubilation as he´s made friends with thumper.	JH	1	ケイ	よろこ.び	
2158	lovely	LỆ	麗	lovely, one, ceiling, mediocre, deer, cave, antlers, compare, ceiling2, mediocre2, compare2	19	54	The painting of a deer itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something lovely. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two mediocre drawings from a later age on two patches of ceiling above. Note that the drop in mediocre has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight.		"The anthropologist made an exact deer painting from the cave ceiling on the ceiling of his house. Too bad they´re both mediocre. All his wife could say was, ""How...lovely.""."	Lovely bambi.... pictographe : just take a look at those innocent open eyes (part 1 it´s not more far fetched than seeing mediocre in it) with thin eyebrows what a lovely deer ...(part 2).

Most don´t know it, but bears have the ability to walk on fire. They´re invincible creatures!	"Note : I don´t know why James Heisig put ""bear"" ahead of ""ability"" (next frame), but I sugget to skip this, learn the next kanji (""ability"") then go back here and use ability as a primitive."	JH	1	ユウ	くま	熊 (くま)
2160	ability	NĂNG	能	ability, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, spoon, sitting on the ground, spoon2, sitting on the ground2	10	54	Try relating this kanji to that of the previous frame. For instance, you might imagine that the test of ability envisioned here is removing the bear from the oven fire.		The amputee has no hands but only stumps of flesh beneath his elbows. To give him the ability to eat he has two spoons implanted in his arm stumps, one in each side.	"Kid from the Oracle´s place in the Matrix (whose head is shining like the moon) is holding a a spoon and making it bend using his special ability. When Neo asks to learn this ability the child replies, "" Remember the truth Neo, there is no spoon."" Neo Proceeds to the kitchen pondering these words of wisdom. The Child smiles mischeviously and pulls a second spoon hidden up his sleeve in the crook of his elbow. ""That´s right Neo,"" the child laughs, ""there is no spoon...there are two spoons!""."	5	3	ノウ	よ.く	
2161	attitude	THÁI	態	attitude, ability, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, spoon, sitting on the ground, heart, spoon2, sitting on the ground2	14	54	Ability . . . heart.		This guy has an attitude problem – lots of ability, but his heart´s not in it.	Having a good attitude means believing in your heart that you have the ability to do anything - like memorizing more than 2000 kanji, for example.	5	1	タイ	わざ.と	
2162	sign of the tiger	DẦN	寅	sign of the tiger, house, caterpillar, one, ceiling, sprout, shoot, animal legs, eight	11	55	House . . . ceiling . . . sprout . . . animal legs. Compare, and do not confuse with, the kanji in frame 1887.		If you draw the sign of the tiger on the ceiling of your house, you will sprout tiger's legs (animal legs) and be able to run and pounce like the big cats yourself.	The sign of the tiger is that he´s eaten all of the yellow (#1750) salad in the house.	Names	1	イン	とら

2164	sign of the dragon	THẦN	辰	sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin	7	55	Cliff . . . two . . . hairpins.		In sign of the dragon, Bruce Lee is such a badass he climbed a sheer vertical cliff using only 2 hairpins.	"The kid said ""I don´t believe you! Dragons don´t exist!"" so we made a little surprise for him: we pinned a huge dragon (it was just a sign really) on a nearby cliff. ""Whoaaa! Dragon!"" the kid said. ""But why won´t it move?""

If you get too close to a fire-breathing dragon, your skin can turn red from the burn. When someone is embarrassed, it's as though they have this sign of the dragon stuck to their face.	The sign of the dragon falls off the cliff, to our great embarassment (see sign of the dragon (#2008)) We should have glued it there!	JH	1	ジョク	はずかし.める	辱める (はずかし.める)

2168	with child	THẦN	娠	with child, woman, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin	10	55	Woman . . . sign of the dragon. The key word is a synonym for pregnant, whose character we met earlier (Frame 546). Although the two kanji are often used together, they should be kept distinct.		Any woman spending a night with the virile Bruce Lee is bound to end up with child.	"The woman hides the dragon from poachers under her shirt, pretending she's with child. ""Seen any sign of the dragon?"" ask the poachers. ""Nope, haven't seen him,"" replies the woman."	JH	1	シン

2170	agriculture	NÔNG	農	agriculture, bend, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin	13	55	Bend . . . sign of the dragon.		Imagine if you could bend a dragon to your will. Helpful in war, yes, but also a boon for agriculture. The dragon could use its sharp claws to plough the ground, and use its firey breath to clear the land. But first you'd have to bend the dragon to your will -- not an easy task.	It's a good agricultural sign when, as the farmer is bending down, he discovers some plants arranged in the sign of the dragon. It means the weather and earth will be supportive of the crops.	3	2	ノウ

Ghosts aren't very intelligent - they have but a drop of brains - so can't tell the difference between an elbow and a pair of human legs.	A ghost, or oni, wandering slowly on its human legs, searching for brains to eat. What looks like an elbow here is actually a pictoral representation of the forked tail protruding out of its rear.

Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji ""imperial dragon"". Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a slingshot (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our imperial dragon here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare ""three-headed slingshot-snake"" kept in a vase and fed with meat.

However, they are not well known for actually watching where the heck they are bounding about. Here we have a bunch of dead deer bodies that you find at the foot of a mountain. You are trying to figure why there are so many dead deer in one spot, and then you trace a line up the mountain - leaves and such are scattered all the way up...to a grove. Looks like they hopped through some leaves to their doom.	JH		ロク	ふもと	麓 (ふもと)

By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the ""dwarf planet"" Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the crowning deed of day six of the creation."		The beast of hades one day will wear a crown, and the number of the beast is 666.	In Hades you have to work six days a week before crowning it with something vaguely resembling a weekend.

You decide to go salmon fishing, so you ride a mountain goat to the top of the road. Under the light of the moon, as it's illegal, you catch the salmon going upstream.	In this kanji we see a mountain goat that decided to go upstream along a road, but for some reason it will only go upstream when the full moon is up. It's actually stubborn like a mountain goat about not going upstream along the road at any other period of time. The road itself is also very confused about this.	JH		ソ、サク	さかのぼ.る	遡る (さかのぼ.る)

1011	stationery	Tiên (báo, giấy)	箋・䇳	stationery, bamboo, float, fiesta, float*, fiesta2	12	26	Bamboo . . . float. Note that the drawing of the primitive for float uses the abbreviated form that has become standard in the general-use kanji and as we met it earlier (Frames 393-95). Until such time as typesetting fonts make the adjustment, only the older form has been approved. Here we have opted for the simpler, avant garde drawing.		Note: the spelling should be stationery (= paper, office supplies), not stationary (= not moving). The error is in the original book.

Metaphorically speaking, all the equipment in your mouth is basically just a meeting of butchers, designed to pulverize whatever meat you put in there.	Metaphor: A good metaphor flows from the mouth like the meeting of flesh and saber, smoothly piercing the listener with its meaning. But a bad metaphor is like when you barely nick the flesh and only spill two drops of blood or when your saber doesn't penetrate at all but rather bends into a くく shape when you whack the flesh.

2120	gloom	ÚC	鬱		29	53	"Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from melancholy (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material depression we met in Frame 1421). The picture of gloom begins with a small grove of trees, under which we see a crown made out of used tin cans. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of Remembering the Kanji. It is composed of a shovel with a sheaf dotted with small drops on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop shovel attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ ""Bulldozing in the sheaves, bulldozing in the sheaves..."" ♪ The drops represent the chaff flying about as the sheaves are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is someone sitting on the ground alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your tin-can crown. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the grove, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-shaping of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of gloom down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations."		"In the middle of the final GROVE you find a TIN CAN. There's a CROWN inside! You are very excited with this, but then someone appears behind you: ""Hey, gimme that kid!"" You look and it's WOLVERINE, with a SHOVEL on his back and all covered in 鹵 (#2879). ""I found that crown in the rocksalt mines over there, so hand it over!"" - You unwillingly hand him the crown and he goes away. Then you SIT ON THE FLOOR, feeling impotent, and the SHAPE of your face becomes all GLOOMY ☹ (完)."	The context of gloom here refers to an environmental disaster that humans make. The story begins at a GROVE with TIN CANS shaped like CROWNS which are really soda cans. They belonged to workers who bulldozes (or SHOVELS) lots and lots of SHEAVES with DROPS of its pieces. Afar, a boy is SITTING while watching the workers reSHAPING the environment. His face now has a very gloomy expression.	JH		ウツ	うっ.する、 しげ.る、 ふさ.ぐ
